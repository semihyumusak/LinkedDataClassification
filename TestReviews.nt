 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strange_Mercy> <http://dbpedia.org/property/rev> "The most versatile album, not only by St. Vincent (aka Annie Clark) but of the past few years, offers a plethora of delicious snippets. AThe most versatile album, not only by St. Vincent (aka Annie Clark) but of the past few years, offers a plethora of delicious snippets. A mental stunner of an album unfolds with a mixture of voluble guitar mayhem, head-bopping brass sections, and twee electro beats. Not only has Annie Clark grown as a musician, she has blossomed into one of indie rock's most unique staples. The eponymous  album begins with a shaky, frantic progressive track entitled "Rattlesnake". It slowly brings the audience closer and closer to the new image Annie has given herself. By the end of the track, the hair is let down, the feet are dancing, and the ever-creative guitar shrieks emerge in full force. Crank the amp up to 11, you're in for a joyride. The album's first single, "Birth In Reverse", offers an arrangement of head-scratching lyrics involving daily routines along with the type of instrumentals for a fast car ride. "Prince Johnny", an angelic, yet peculiar addition gives off simple vibes at the beginning. A seemingly innocent track trudges on until the voice of an angel cuts in to sing a few bars of nothingness. To describe the sheer beauty of this track would be an understatement, no matter how it is described. Just listen and fall in love. "Huey Newton" follows, giving quirky electro rhythms, heavy percussion beats, and soft, sultry acoustic riffs. Once again, this track explodes towards the end, letting a head-banging rock opera materialize. The following single, "Digital Witness", allows the listener to hear the obvious David Byrne influences. With a jazzy brass instrumentation, this track could be considered a bonus track from St. Vincent's 2012 collaboration with David Byrne, Love This Giant. And damn, is it ever catchy. "I Prefer Your Love" slows things down with an classic St. Vincent style, returning to the slow drums, the synth beats, and the calm vocals. This track shows that even with the power of a rock star, St. Vincent can still make a tranquil piece. However, the tranquility doesn't last long when "Regret" rolls in. With a slick bass line, heavenly acoustics, and the always beautiful vocals of Ms. Clark, it's an instant classic. "Bring Me Your Loves" is new. It's a track hidden at the end of unchartered territory. A new, frenzied pace of music sets this song apart from the rest of the album. With heavy guitar bits, an acapella section, and electronic rhythms from outer space, this brilliant, yet insane track provides a different side to the usual sounds heard. "Psychopath", a more straight-forward song, offers more bellowing guitar riffs, even if you were tired of them. With a incomparable instrumentation, it is another reminder of the David Byrne influence. As the album begins to end, "Every Tear Disappears" gives one final shout. Although it isn't an mad dash of sporadic beats, it finalizes the more unique side of Annie Clark's new-found music style. "Severed Crossed Fingers", the end of a masterpiece, the "ride off into the sunset as the credits roll" moment, is the perfect way to finish. Not only does it calm the listeners back down, it allows them to reflect on the last 40 minutes of their lives. What they just finished listening to is something exceptional. Something unable to be replicated. St. Vincent's fourth effort could be considered her best. It brings in new elements while remaining faithful to the style that got her where she is today. I admire St. Vincent and all she has accomplished. She is not only my favourite female vocalist, but also a top contender for the genre of indie rock. Congrats to you Annie.

Well that's so gibberish (jokes aside), this is one heck-of a masterpiece singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark has been cooking up. With a slide help on the production side from John Congleton, we have, sonically wise an cinematic and colorful experience through out. A journey full of heavy synthesizers, drown-out guitar riffs, distorted sequences. An album, experimental one, which blends the best bags off indie pop/rock music with an ounce of more electronic touch to it all.A record, yet beautiful, but grimy when Ms. Clark at times comes on twisted, lyrically. Lyrically a more odd figure in todays indie pop/rock I've heard in a while, she's quite unique, so is the writing on this. I love it, really loving it.And a guitarist as St. Vincent, as innovative of a solo artist, there's have a few off. Some of the most catchiest hooks, rythms, melodies and instrumentals we are going to have around in twenty-fourteen. Annie Clark is definitely one original and creative artist in music, an artist willing to push the culture, pop, rock, whatever she lays her hands on forward. If it's ballads, or up-tempo tracks, what you wont be bored with, is her angelic voice. An extrodinary piece of work from St. Vincent, one of top records we are going to sum up at the end of the year. This self-titled LP is one of the most interesting records I've came across, a favorite it is, St. Vincent is up to top this decade, better watch out.… Full Review »"@en .

It is thrilling, exciting, strange and incredibly refreshing! A highly original album. I have not heard any of the other albums, so I cannot compare this to them - but I have heard that this is quite different sonically, so I certainly look forward to listening to those albums. This album does have some flaws, albeit very minor - and that is that some of the songs don't really leave up to the excitement of other songs, but however they are still great songs. Also I think the order of the songs should have been put more coherently, though this doesn't really affect the album. Fans would probably like this due to it's different sound (according to fans) and to it's exciting production, but I must warn; not everyone may like the album due to it being strange upon first listen.

This album's atmosphere transfers you back to the time of Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais as the album slowly reveals itself and through Cradle's lyrics and music, you almost feel like you are in a heavy metal 15th century surrounded by murder, perversion and conspiracy.

Unsurprisingly, the lyrics were deep and enlightening, the sound was sweet and nostalgic, and the concepts were original and powerful in message. Even though it doesn't come together as a single LP (as he would do later in channel ORANGE), this was a great collection of ear-pleasing, indulging songs, especially for free. Even though Def Jam/Island's attempt to physically release it collapsed, it did allow the Universally aclaimmed song "Swim Good" to hit mainstream airwaves, thus its nomination for 3 Video Music Awards over the summer. Ocean's other single off this work, "Novacane", has been titled as "The Song of the Year" worldwide for 2011. Ocean also gets personal in the strong tracks "Songs for Women", "We All Try", and "Nature Feels". The production is vast yet well done. The Free mixtape even manages to cause controversy over the track "American Wedding," which uses the instrumental to the Eagles' "Hotel California" with Ocean singing original wordplay over it, which caused the band to threaten a lawsuit if he was to ever perform it live. Even though the Theme of "Nostalgia, ULTRA" is hard to grasp or immediately detect, Ocean still seems to get a message stuck in your brain.Personal Favorites: "We All Try", "Songs for Women", "Dust", "Bitches Talkin' (Metal Gear Solid)"Recommend: "Strawberry Swing", "Swim Good", "American Wedding"… Full Review »"@en .

The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to. TrevorFly from Here the new album by Yes is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to. Trevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer/cowriter, and the product is brilliant. Note: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album). This release also marks the debut of BenoÃ®t David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track "Fly from Here" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled "We Can Fly from Here". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to BenoÃ®t David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part "Fly from Here". This album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!… Full Review »"@en .

With Trevor Horn producing and Geoff Downes on keyboards, you might expect it to sound a lot like Drama from 1980, but it doesn't.  I think the main reason is Steve Howe.  On Drama it seemed like they were trying to be a metal group at times, but there's a lot of acoustic guitar on Fly From Here and a different style of playing entirely.The title track should appeal to you if you liked Close To The Edge.  I like that each section works pretty well on it's own, but it sounds like a complete suite when they are played together.  The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be is a beautiful ballad from Chris Squire.  Hour of Need is almost a folk song and features a great acoustic performance from Howe, along with the instrumental Solitaire.  Into The Storm is the hardest rocker.There are a couple of missteps - Bumpy Ride is cheesy and Life On A Film Set sounds like a mediocre ELP song, with lots of overly dramatic flourishes and pauses.

Matchbox Twenty has great rock/pop sounds thatAngry (9.25) This is a great song to lead off the album I think. It has great instrumentals. Matchbox Twenty has great rock/pop sounds that are really great. I love when the chorus hits and the song takes off alot with the cool little use of electronica after the chorus ends for the first time. The back up singers are great to and keep the mood of the album light instead of dark. The main guitar solo is really great as well in the middle end of the song. Black & White People (9) This song has great jazz overtones with the trumpets. This song has a great beat and the chorus is great like in the song before it. And I love how they talk about Black and White in the song. I think this song kind of promotes unity between races and people of different cultures. Crutch (9.25) This is one of my favorite songs on the album because of the catchy chorus. It was really great live when I saw them live and the performance has stuck ever since. The background singers add a great element. Near the middle end of the song the melody kind of changes which is great and there is a good guitar solo near the end and the song finishes off clean. Last Beautiful Girl (9) This song is great to me because it's kind of a hybrid of a love song and a mainstream rock song if that makes sense. The lyrics are delivered at various speeds which makes the song interesting I think and keeps the albums energy up big time. When the tempo switches I always get a little head bob going. If Your Gone (9) In this song, Matchbox Twenty slows the tempo quite a bit and keeps the album very interesting for listener. I think it is a really great song to cope with loss of someone you love. I really like how Matchbox Twenty incorporates the trumpets within the song as well. They change the tone of the song when they repeat the chorus with the trumpets, and it makes it better I feel. Mad Season (9) With this song, Matchbox Twenty switches back to more of an electric sound. I have told I am a little crazy so I really like the title of the song as well. Like usual, the chorus is really awesome and is very stimulating to the ear along with the trademark guitar riff. The quick solo near the middle end of the song with the electric guitar is really great. At the end, the beat cools off to finish the song with good style. Rest Stop (8.5) The fade out from the last song really is incorporated in this track well. The track is soothing and the violins really add to that element. I also think it's really great that Matchbox Twenty uses multiple different types of guitars to really create a great song. The guitar solo is great like in all their songs and I'm glad they follow a good formula to make their songs standout. The Burn (8.5) This song incorporates a minor amount of jazz overtones as well as Piano elements. The three quirky little guitar notes adds a nice little touch to the song I think. The song maintains a conservative approach to the tones generated but it still sounds good I think. Bent (9) This song was one of the singles from the album I believe. The chorus is really good and I love the whole theme behind the song. He probably is singing to someone who he cares about and feels that he is all messed up and he needs help to maintain his sanity. The tempo and tone changes later in the song and makes the song more dynamic I think. The guitar solos in this piece are great as well. Bed Of Lies (9) This is one of my favorite non mainstream songs by Matchbox Twenty. It's because of how unique the sound generated is. It kind of sounds like a contemporary church song I think. I hope I don't offend Matchbox Twenty with that comment. At this point in the album, I am glad it is slowing down and they are really showing their depth of creativity within their minds. Leave (8.5) Another slow paced song near the end of the album which really creates a mood like you are in a jazz lounge or something. The song has a conservative tone which I think is good at this stage in the album. Stop (8.5) I like how Matchbox Twenty picks up the tempo in this song and has minor country tones in the guitar, especially in the beginning. The simple guitar riff is really great even and while the lyrics are pretty simple, it does have a pretty catchy beat. The Piano within the song adds a good element like usual especially how it leads into the guitar solo later in the song. The song finishes with a good strong guitar riff. You Won't Be Mine (8.5) This song is Piano heavy and I like that. The tempo is slowed back down and has heavy jazz overtones in the instrumentals and has strings and some sort of sound from a unknown source which I thought was cool. The sound of this song I thought was a good way to finish off the album. And I also love the length of the track. It kind of represents a song/outro.… Full Review »"@en .

This is a man who has been inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame and is one of the most talented musicians.  Whether he was in Genesis or solo he was one of the best drummers, singers, and songwriters in the business. Yet, he managed to create one of the worst albums I have ever heard. It may not be the worst, but certainly top 5. In between the Tarzan and Brother Bear soundtrack Phil Collins released Testify, which is one of his worst selling for a reason. This album just reeks with lack luster, for instance, I have heard several songs b the name of "The Least You Can Do"", but this one sounds just like all the other songs in the album. All the tracks blend together as one long adult contemporary wave. Each song  alone does no harm, but together they fuse into a Phil Collins cesspool of subdued nonsense . Thru my eyes this is the worst work of an all time great. It's not too late in Phil Collins career to have another comeback, however, this should be a wake up call to fans that he is not the same unique and energetic person he use to be. The way the songs were structured was driving me crazy. Just look at all the other reviews of this album to testify my statements.… Full Review »"@en .

While it doesn't take many risks, the songs are interesting and catchy, and her soulful voice fits extremely well. The epic sound that makes us feel that her music is performed by a great big band is something many artists and bands wish for; the only ones I've noticed manage it well are Kasabian, Within Temptation and Nightwish.

In fact, since the day of release, I've put it in my car player and it hasn't come out since. I am still not tired of (most) of the songs! The CD starts off intense with C'Mon, which I consider to be one of their finest songs ever, both lyrically and musically.The second absolute highlight is when track number five comes up: The Broken.The triumphant Nothing's Free makes me want to sing along and turn the volume up every single time it comes up, even when I'm in bad moods. Right This Time closes the album off nicely and on a positive note, which seems to become a tradition for the band, as their previous album, the self-titled from 2004, did something similar.Next to these outstanding songs, most others are just plain good. The up-paced Same  Different Drink, Miss You Gone and You Did It, but also the slower songs: She Don't Know, The Wall and Here's To Us. This last one is a tribute to former drummer Allen and it's a beautiful message. My least favorite song is probably Partner in Crime. The first few weeks I really enjoyed it, but I have to be honest that it gets old pretty soon. A "flaw" that not many Lit songs have had over the years. Don't look for Lit to give you innovating music with fancy bells.

I have noticed some critics have bashed the concept of this record, but concepts have never really been what sucks me into this band's records, rather it is the music, style, and hook of it. This record is tight and overcomes some of the setbacks that their previous record, Mama I'm Swollen, and ventures into a more aggressive style that I've not heard from Cursive since Domestica, which I love. Songs that stand out for me are "Warmer, Warmer", "Sun and Moon", "Gemini", and the last minute or two of "Eulogy for No Name" rock my brain. But "Twin Dragon/Hello Skeleton" stands out as the best Cursive tune I've heard since "The Martyr". This song has such a cool groove to it, a great beat, interesting guitars, quirky keyboard parts, and awesome vocal hooks. The second I heard it, I was sold on this record. The mixing of the record is also very well done. Most records these days are over produced and have lost any sense of dynamic. Having twelve separate guitar tracks blasting the same riff is not what I call interesting. Whereas with this record, more often than not you hear one or two tracks playing, with an extra one or two guitars added in the choruses, giving it the stomp box effect. The drums are superbly mixed with the bass and Tim Kasher's vocals are not over powering to the detriment of the rest of the record, making I am Gemini a truly enjoyable listen.In the end, this is a welcome addition to Cursive's repertoire.

But in this case, with this album, I feel like it's some sort of civic duty as a fan of music to spread the gospel of this album's perfection.  I won't start an inflammatory discussion that this is possibly the best album of all time, in the sense that the usual definition of album is an unaffiliated collection of songs - I'm sure that most would give that distinction to myriad Beatles, Dylan, Radiohead, etc albums, and it's largely a matter of age and personal taste, anyway.  What I WILL start the discussion of, is that this IS possibly the best "album" of all time - I use the quotes to stress a different definition of what an album is; in this definition, a cohesive collection of songs that are linked by a common lyrical or aesthetic genesis.  I cringe at the label of  "concept album", as that seems to invoke a knee-jerk assumption that the album is either about some science-fiction fantasy or that it's a directionless piece of instrumental junk that uses the "concept" moniker as a free pass to, well, suck.    What The Roots have created is an album that tells a story in amazingly communicative detail, without beating you over the head that you're being told a story.  Left to their own devices, the listener would probably have an 'aha!' moment somewhere about 20 listens into this album that the songs were in fact all connected, and in a linear [albeit backwards] fashion.  This not only respects the intelligence of the listener to figure it out, it keeps the emphasis on the music where it belongs.  They have created an album that bridges the gap between meaningful connection between the songs, and the ability for each song to be a successful, enjoyable single in its own right.  You can rock each of these tracks out of order at a party and nod your head with the grooves for an hour, or you could listen to it in proper order in a classroom and have a 2-hour debate about fate, responsibility, and socio-economic politics.   You need to own this album.

Would I have ended up in another state?  Perhaps gone to college, got a helluva job?  Met someone, settled down, had kids, and the stereotypical American Dream?Or was I always destined to end up where I'm at now?  I thought about that as I listened to Undun, because it made me wonder whether Redford was doomed from the beginning.  Whether his ending was predetermined from jump street and that he realized that and simply embraced what he felt was his destiny.It's definitely an interesting conversation piece, I think.  And that, ultimately, is what separates The Roots from your average hip hop artists out there.  The Roots stay coming correct with their intelligent and introspective works, while many others tend to focus on more materialistic gains.Unfortunately too many people would rather Watch The Throne, rather than get their heads into some real solid intelligent hip hop music.  And that's sad, but unfortunately a part of life.As the album ends, it has it's final piece, a cover of singer Sufjan Stevens' song Redford, split into four "movements", and tell the "beginning" of Stephen's life. The first part is Sufjan himself on the piano, followed by a string quartet interpreting the song.  After that you have Roots' drummer Questlove and pianist D.D. Jackson going to work, and then the final movement, which actually represents the beginning of Redford Stephen's life.As I'm listening right now to the final four tracks that form this sort of orchestral movement it's absolutely stunningly beautiful!  I mean I've read online where there were some who heard the album and didn't like the final four tracks and felt that it would have been better ending on the 10th track.I think those who feel this way are missing the whole idea of a concept album, and how every piece fits.  Every piece tells a part of the story.  Every piece serves a purpose.  And personally, I actually thought I'd be moved to tears by the 12th track "Possibility".  It was amazing in a way that words can't express.To sum up, this is yet again, another potentially classic album by a group that we've come to expect excellence from.  However just because we have grown to expect this type of brilliance, doesn't negate or diminish the quality of this album.Some of the usual suspects show up for appearances including Dice Raw, Phonte, P.O.R.N. and Truck North, as well as Big K.R.I.T. who has a great future ahead of him in hip hop.I also liked some of the vocalists on here including Bilal, Livingston and even Mercedes Martinez & Tracy Moore, of Jazzyfatnastees fame, who contributed the vocals to "I Remember" which is outstanding!All in all, if you like good hip hop music, if you like good MUSIC period, you need to do yourself a favor and pick this up!… Full Review »"@en .

I can just picture them in some dim lit warehouse somewhere like mad scientists determining which note goes where and with what instrument and how loud to make each note and so on and so forth. It may not seem like that at first listen, but with repeated listens you will soon find out how much time and effort they put into 'Lisbon'. It's their most simplistic yet complex album yet. It's a well rounded mix of all the greatness of their previous albums but it doesn't feel old at all. It's as though they've figured out a way of making all their strengths feel new and refreshed. From the ballad and first single "Stranded" which sounds like an album highlight from '100 miles off' to the intrepid title track, "Lisbon", that could have been 'Everybody who Pretended to like me is gone's' most idealistic single, the Walkmen dazzle in every way. The opener "Juveniles" is a perfect start to 'Lisbon'. It's slow and bending lyrics sound as though they are about to embark on a journey and they want you to sit back, drink your whiskey, open your mind and let your thoughts flow. As the end of the song echoes, "you're one of us or you're one of them", you will start to question which one you are as you anxiously await the ride to continue. There are a few faster paced songs on the album like "Angela Surf City", which will probably be the biggest single on the album just because it's more of the sound the Walkmen are popular for. "Victory" and "Woe is Me" are great emotionally charged high velocity tempo storms that crash you with promise and misery all in a matter of minutes. Other than these three songs the rest of the album sits in the bondage of haste and perseverance. The only setback on the album is "Follow the Leader". I only say it's a setback because it seems unfinished to me. It has perfect rhythm and smooth lyrics but just didn't seem complete and it kind of halted the album with two very strong tracks before it. On the other hand, I see why its on the album. It builds up to the highlight, "Blue as your Blood". "Blue as your Blood" is the Walkmen's best song to date. As Hamilton croons "Life rolled us over like a town car/Bruised up and busted to the ground", you can feel the sentimentality in his voice. It should be the anthem for every love story, every severed relationship, every guy/girl sitting at a bar thinking about the years past, drinking their favorite drink contemplating every decision, good and bad, they've made over the span of their life. Yes, it's that good. "While I shovel the snow" reminds me of my childhood in Chicago, thinking of times past and what's transpired since. It brought back memories I forgot I had. It's simplicity and candid emotion will bring tears to your eyes and happiness to your soul. The lines "half of my life I've been watching/half of my life I've been waking up" will make you want to go back to that childhood and slap yourself in the face, tell yourself to do something with your wretched painful life ahead. "Torch Song" and "All the Great Designs" are standouts as well. They keep the album moving at a soul binding pace. As the album digs at your every thought and bulletproof emotion, not stopping until the end of the title track, "Lisbon", hits you and makes you crave a cigar and another drink to flourish what just transpired. But you cant go on this ride just once. It's like your 12 again at six flags on a Tuesday during the summer when there are no lines...just you and the rollercoaster and you keep riding it over and over again...feeling the pain and nauseau of the rollercoaster's jolt but loving every minute of it. You hunger and crave for more. The only thing that's missing from this album is taste and scent, but if you delve hard and long enough you swear you can smell that old after shave lotion your father use to wear or taste those homemade mash potatoes your mom use to make because memories is what this album is about. Metronomes aren't needed because 'Lisbon' doesn't follow any sort of compliance or standard, it's original and that's something you cant say much anymore about music today. 'Lisbon' brings emotion, it brings character and most of all it brings memories for The Walkmen stand in the likes of none of their peers because their greatness cannot be compared.… Full Review »"@en .

The opening song, "Wide Eyes", is the perfect song to begin the record with, as it sets the tone of the entire album. The catchy riff and melody leave nothing to be desired indeed. "Airplanes" is a feel-good song with exceptional piano, drums, and vocals. Then again, the vocals are notably performed throughout the entire album. "Sun Hands" is the most rock-inspired song on the album due to its harsher vocals and faster rhythm.  "World News" is one of my favorite songs of the album because of its highly catchy guitar parts and ambitious vocals. The next four songs are some of my least favorite of the album, but offer good vibes nonetheless. Of these four, "Camera Talk" is definitely my favorite. The ninth song on the album, "Who Knows Who Cares," is my favorite song on the record. The calm and memorable guitar riff, the emotional pop vocals, the ascending intensity of the song, and the intense drum interlude all combine to create a majestic specimen of indie-pop. The last three songs really put a great end to the album. "Cubism Dream" carries some surprisingly powerful musical momentum that is satisfyingly released at the end of the song. "Stranger Things" incorporates a very pleasing strings section and contains one of my favorite verse melodies of the album.

As far as the lyrics... well, you probably won't feel deeply challenged by them, but if you're anything like me they'll manage to lodge themselves in your heart pretty quickly. Mitchell has a way of unfurling the story of a song in perfect synchrony with her song structures; 'Dyin' Day' is reminiscent of "The Wall" from her Hadestown album, in that it slowly builds a powerful lyrical idea using repetitive but evolving call-and response verses. That song is a highlight. Others include the title track, whose restless, hungry hero evokes immediate sympathy, and "Coming Down", a quiet and wistfully sad little tune. I will say that beyond those songs, none of the others have really grabbed me in the two days I've had to listen to it, but that might be because I have tracks 2-4 more or less on repeat.

The title itself isRadiohead, under the gun of expectation, have not disappointed with their eighth studio album "The King of Limbs." The title itself is provocative of something large, and even the album cover hints as well. The King of Limbs is very drum heavy, which is somewhat of a step away from their usual routine, but still manages to resonate the true Radiohead frequencies. One thing that sticks out is the evident direction with which Radiohead seems to be tending. This album leans toward a modern classical direction. This may be due to leader Thom Yorke's infatuation with dubstep and certain electronic music. On the other hand, the band still keeps its grounding, with Johnny Greenwood's haunting keyboards, and Colin's bass driving the beats of Phil Selway's lathered drum section. The King of Limbs is very beat heavy, with Thom using his voice to complement the aura surrounding the left and right that make up the production of Nigel Godrich. There is a different Radiohead in every one of the eight songs on The King of Limbs, with the majority of the tunes relating back to the second set of songs on In Rainbows. Lotus Flower, which has a brilliant video concurrently released today, is the awe-inspiring track to The King of Limbs. It contains hints of dubstep, but also plays fairly close to Idioteque. Thom Yorke's vocals on this album as a whole reach high and low, as expected from Radiohead nearly twenty years now. One prolific aspect of this album is the ability Yorke encompasses during his "sliding" of vocals. Yorke, now in his forties, still has the power he had back in 2000's Kid A, and continues to create new avenues to hone and elaborate his use of vocals. Radiohead never ceases to disappoint, and certainly do not do so here. The album is just under forty minutes in length, which is a true disappointment, but I hope the "Newspaper" edition that comes out will contain bonus songs or something of the sort. Radiohead's eighth album The King of Limbs is a knocker with power, force, and a soul to reckon with, the only inhibition the album may experience is its length-challenged state. But this may also be a strength. It may cause a desire for more! Keep the people guessing. They have been keeping the public guessing since way back in September, why stop now? I would also like to strike a chord with the lyric substance in the album. The album contains parts, in its minute state, with little lyrical substance, which, in my opinion, can be disappointing. I will say it now that, the length and lyrical shortcomings may cause a negative stir among the Radiohead fan base. But if you ask me, this album is In Rainbow's antagonist. It takes In Rainbows, and flips it on its side. A new world of music, but keeps the Radiohead vibrations resonating. This album is brilliant. It is no surprise nor expectation fulfilled. It is Radiohead without being typical or predictable.… Full Review »"@en .

The rest of the album is filled with hipster experimental electronica, and stupidly mumbled vocals such as "Good Morning Mr. Magpie, how are we today." There's no soul, no melody, no groove, no feeling or emotion. Someone hipster might say "you don't get the music man" but trust me: I do. This is easily Radiohead's worst album.

Ten years may have passed since his last record yet his words are still timelessly relevant and his street teachings carry as much weight as they ever have (he was once considered the greatest MC of all time). The record is distinctly personal and therefore won't strike a chord with those who are used to the disposable records that are so widely produced. Rakim's unique angle characterises his artistic direction and exposes his substantial talents. 'How to Emcee' is one of the few standout tracks though his unassuming gangster style does him no favours in appealing to those who have never heard of him.  9/10   85/100… Full Review »"@en .

The title track "Winning Days" finishes with an uplifting flourish unmatched by any of their previous recordings, and songs like "Animal Machine" and the crowd (and advertising) favourite "Ride" retain the high energy rock edge that gave The Vines their initial reputation, lending themselves brilliantly to live performance.The problem I saw with this album's initial reception, is that most media critics were looking for an album stacked with 12 versions of Get Free, Outtathaway and Ride - often describing Winning Days as "bland".

There is no denying that in the matter of a few short years, this will be looked back upon as a classic, and I will surely have no arguments towards that.… Full Review »"@en .

With a fusion of rock and EDM, they have a sound that is irresistible.LCD Soundsystem, the ultimate hipster band, are a great crossover act. With a fusion of rock and EDM, they have a sound that is irresistible. "Sound of Silver" continues where there eponymous debut leaves off. Starting with the rhythmic "Get Innocuous", it's almost 2 minutes before we hear something other than a percussion instrument in the mix. The track works itself into a hypnotic groove and for a while you wonder if this record is going to be an exclusively dance music affair. "Time to Get Away" is more understated and moves away from EDM maelstrom of the opening track. It's reminiscent of Talking Heads at times and this is always a good thing. Next we have one of the bands biggest hits, "North American Scum", a track which is an ideal microcosm of the bands sound - pop, rock and the coolest elements of dance music. "Someone Great" is deservedly put at the centre of the album - a real centrepiece track that builds gradually towards a feeling of elation before winding itself down again. One of the bands best tracks and worth the entry fee alone to hear. "All My Friends" is a similar builder, over 7 minutes long, we start with a pounding piano with distorted guitars gradually making their way into the mix. "Us Vs Them" is one of the few disappointing moments on the record. Clocking in at over 8 minutes, this is the only time I can accuse James Murphy of self indulgence. "Watch the Tapes" gets things back on track with it's urgency and immediacy before the album's title track, an ode to 80's dance. The likes of Depeche Mode and New Order are written all over this one. "New York I Love You But You'r Bringing Me Down" closes proceedings and is one of the finest endings to an album your likely to hear. Lou Reed would have been proud of this one, with Murphy at his lyrical finest. As soon as it finishes you just want to hit play again. A pleasure of an album.… Full Review »"@en .

However, As I Lay Dying is by far the band is at the top of the food chain in the metalcore.Vocally, Tim has some extra sounds behind his voices in this album. They seem to be a little deeper and lower than in previous albums. But do not worry about the clean vocals are still present and are quite impressive. The Powerless Rise seems to have something extra out of Tim, almost like he was shouting directly to listeners on this album. As usual in the letters, there is no mention of Christ, but his lyrics have Christian center in which we invite you to not cling to the things of this world but to fight for what is eternal.I can not imagine what would be the music without AILD, these titans continue to put the measure on such a high level that there might not be any band that comes close to them these days. In my opinion, surpassed his previous work An Ocean Between Us.This album is so good that every song is excellent, You can not miss in your collection… Full Review »"@en .

Apart from Brian Molko's vocals it just doesn't feel like a Placebo record. It might be the brighter, more positive sound of the record or it might be the strange pop like production. There is definitley a placebo shaped hole in the middle of this album and it just isn't as spikey as other Placebo records. Strangely enough the band re-released the record a year after its initial release in remastered form, a treatment usually reserved for records that are decades old. The remastered version is a marked improvement, with the new mix giving the record a fuller and deeper sound. It has definitely helped me to hear the record in a different light and the more I've listened to it over the last few years the more I like it.  I'm still not sure if I would rate it above any other Placebo record but I have decided it is a very decent record, undeserving of the criticism its received. For those who don't like it  perhaps try the "redux" (remastered) version. It's definitely a better record. Getting to the songs, they are still different to the traditional Placebo sound being more power chord rock than glam/goth rock. The band obviously tried to go in a different direction with this record and for that should be commended rather than lambasted. There are plenty of excellent tracks on it but perhaps is spread a little too thin at 13 tracks. That said, I can find positives with every track, even "The Never Ending Why", my least favourite track on the record, has a nice dancy chorus. In fact there are several times throughout the album where I'm reminded of the bands cover of Boney M's Daddy Cool, be that a good or bad thing. The worst thing about the album is that lyrically at times it takes itself a bit too seriously, and also the fact that Trigger Happy Hands was omitted from it and included on a bonus disk on a reissued version of the album.  For the most part it's a very strong album. … Full Review »"@en .

 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweet_Heart_Sweet_Light> <http://dbpedia.org/property/rev> "I've been thinking about this album a lot, which qualifies Jason Spaceman for some kind of lifetime achievement award, or as another criticI've been thinking about this album a lot, which qualifies Jason Spaceman for some kind of lifetime achievement award, or as another critic suggested, a "public service" honor.  My first inclination is to compare it to other albums by Spiritualized, because I found myself thinking once this one managed to sink in for what it "is," "this is as good as Pure Phase [my favorite on there being 'These Blues'] and Lazer Guided Melodies."  This means a lot, seeing I've been following all the records and seeing the live shows over the last few years, and these thoughts just didn't come up even though I liked what I was hearing each time, a lot.  Most people prefer "Ladies and Gentlemen..." above the other LPs, which has some of the best moments in Spiritualized, no doubt.  I generally like abstraction, so high points for me have been "Pure Phase" and "Lazer Guided Melodies" (to give the reader some idea, I adore Slowdive's last album "Pygmalion" - very abstract).  And I prefer the recently released demos for "Ladies and Gentlemen" a bit more than the actual album, which in parts has always been a little too polished for me, notwithstanding the brilliance of "Come Together" or "Cop Shoot Cop," say.  Anyway, this new album I have concluded is among the top four Spiritualized albums -  it's the fourth added to the three top-tier entries, in my view, already mentioned, and maybe even the top one; this one seals the deal, a deal I didn't even realize needed to be sealed beforehand.  "Sweet Heart, Sweet Light" is probably best seen not in comparison to the others, however, but as a capstone - a real capstone, not the kind of "capstone" administrators want to sign you up for.  "I Am What I Am" is one of the finest tautological moments in recent rock n roll, and is on par with "Cop Shoot Cop," to which Dr. John also added piano.  The last track, "So Long You Pretty Thing" - whose appeals to Jesus with a new genuineness at first threw me entirely (I was like "huh?" as on the cover) - is perhaps the finest thing Jason Spacemen has ever written.  There is a new depth here represented perfectly by the very end of "Hey Jane"  where after a set of "Nah Nahs"  he and others sing "Sweet heart, sweet light, sweet heart and love of my life."  This album takes at least a dozen listens to sink in; even those "Nah Nahs," which for me now are like gates opening up to paradise in the here and now, seemed trite to me on the first few listens ; indeed "Hey Jane" sounded repetitive and lazy to me the first few listens until it came together for me subjectively; now I see it for what it "is" - the mark of an album opened as phenomenally as it is closed ("So Long You Pretty Thing").  When you read very negative reviews of this album, they echo some of my own initial impressions, about how the lyrics are cliched (wishing "one could fly," say), or about fitting a particular Spiritualized prescription we know a bit too well.  But here I think you might be hearing from people who didn't give this album enough time.  Unlike those who filed a review before giving a nice amount of time, consider giving it two to three weeks, and I'm convinced if Rolling Stone had listened a few more weeks, they would have given this album at least four stars rather than three and a half, which is strong for them as is.  The album is stellar.  I'd like to point out the wonderfully consistent approach to the lyrics in "I Am What I Am," where things are turned inside out over and over, which is beautifully dialectical (kind of like turning a glove inside out) - "I am the road that drives the cars," for example.  There is a conceptual consistency to the lyrics in this song that easily qualifies it as contemporary art; that said, there's a beauty that everyone can get this for ten to twenty five dollars unlike Damien Hirst's prints, say.  I disagree that there is nothing new lyrically here: there is a greater variety of entry points to reality and emotions than on earlier records and a (still sophisticated) hope that has me listening to earlier Spiritualized records and thinking "I'm really into where they are right now... I'm happy for them."  Also, the references to having "wasted time," 'for real',  on this album are new lyrically, matched with a gritty honesty that's also new.  Lastly, if you can see them play this one live, do.  They played "Stay with me" nestled within these new songs recently.  In this case you could hear the new material beginning to "infect" the earlier music in the best way imaginable.   Spaceman's vocals at the end of "Stay with me" felt more raw and driven by heart-felt content  than on past records, and that's saying something I never thought I'd say.  To pay Jason Spaceman a compliment on his own terms, with new album I can finally separate him, as author, from every song he has ever written, and I like what I'm hearing; sounds like best of 2012 to me.… Full Review »"@en .

 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_the_Skye> <http://dbpedia.org/property/rev> "First off, a warning: the best way to encounter Mastodon's Crack the Skye for the first time is with headphones. Reported to be a mystical -- if crunchy -- concept record about Tsarist Russia, this is actually the most involved set of tracks, both in terms of music and production, the band has ever recorded. "Ambitious" is a word that regularly greets Mastodon -- after all, they did an entire album based on Moby Dick -- but until now, that adjective may have been an understatement. There is so much going on in these seven tracks that it's difficult to get it all in a listen or two (one of the reasons that close encounters of the headphone kind are recommended). It may seem strange that the band worked with Bruce Springsteen producer Brendan O'Brien this time out, but it turns out to be a boon for both parties: for the band because O'Brien is obsessive about sounds, textures, and finding spaces in just the right places; for O'Brien because in his work with the Boss he's all but forgotten what the sounds of big roaring electric guitars and overdriven thudding drums can sound like. The guitar arrangements on tracks like "Divinations" and "The Czar," while wildly different from one another, are the most intricate, melodically complex things the band has ever recorded. There are also more subtle moments such as the menacing, brooding, and ultimately downer cuts such as "The Last Baron," where tempos are slowed and keyboards enter the fray and stretch the time, adding a much more multidimensional sense of atmosphere and texture. Still, Crack the Skye rocks, and hard! Its shifting tempos and key structures are far more meaty and forceful than most prog metal, and menace and cosmological speculation exist in equal measure, providing for a spot-on sense of balance. Some of the hardcore death metal conservatives may have trouble with this set, but the album wasn't recorded for them -- or anybody else. Crack the Skye is the sound of a band stretching itself to its limits and exploring the depth of its collective musical identity as a series of possibilities rather than as signatures. And yes, that is a good thing."@en .

Nas tells little ghetto children to follow their dreams, dedicated songs to his mother who recently died, and had a song with Pac.
