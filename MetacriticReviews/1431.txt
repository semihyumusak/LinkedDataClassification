Electronic music duo the Crystal Method hasn't lost its flair for funk and style as found on the act's debut release, "Vegas."
	Throughout the album, there are moments of brilliance that standout, but are quickly overshadowed by guest who seem to have been chosen against the groupsâ€™ better instincts. If you go in deep, and ignore the co-stars, Divided By Night itself is more than enough to shine on its own.
	Divided By Night continues to raise the bar for the electro wizards. [Spring 2009, p.96]
	Divided by Night is indeed varied and polished, and it includes guest features by the bucketful, but it reveals again that, more than anything, the Crystal Method are merely clever regurgitators of the past, particularly chained to making extroverted dance music that never innovates and rarely excites.
	The prevalence of so many voices, in fact, transforms Divided By Night from a solid if predictable set of well-programmed, well-produced dance tunes into a rote compilation of pop songs.
	Divided By Night has few worthy moments and a whole bunch earmarked for the couple of "Fast & Furious" films. The guys still have the goods, but this album will not be well-remembered.
	This is electronic by numbers. [Jun 2009, p.111]
	Here's the Crystal Method with a not-so-fresh batch of rave-rock jock jams seemingly designed to advertise a car you can no longer afford.
