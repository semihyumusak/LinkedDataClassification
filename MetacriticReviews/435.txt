With Easy Wonderful, Guster has attained that perfect pop rock sound, yet hasn't abandoned its roots as an acoustic trio.
	A charming collection of breezy, hook-filled pop songs.
	If you are looking for big-hearted, easy-to-swallow guitar pop, you could do much worse than Guster. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to do much better.
	These ideas are anything but easy, but on Easy Wonderful, Guster wraps its thoughtful approach to pop with the kind of outsized hooks that the band does better than just about anyone.

	The five-piece band's new album, Easy Wonderful, is full of those same universal ponderings and investigations of love.
	If Guster can grow old and still sound so damn cheerful, maybe everything won't be so drab after all.
