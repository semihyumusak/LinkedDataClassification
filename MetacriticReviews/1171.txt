Nothing groundbreaking, but sure to keep fans of the band happy.
	Friends Chicks Guitars does prove that BFS can still write stonking rock 'n' roll, frat-party anthems, but generally the band make a bigger impact here when they're taking themselves more seriously. [23 Apr 2011, p.52]
	It's not markedly different, better, or worse than previous BFS albums, with the main distinguishing factor being that there's nothing with a killer hook along the lines of "1985," but for the legions of faithful fans, more of the same isn't necessarily a bad thing.
	I was expecting a record full of opportunities to hang BFS out to dry, but there aren't any obvious faux-pas. Fishin' for Woos is solid because when a band is together this long they know what they're doing.
	Fishin' For Woos, the surprising 11th studio album from the band, lacks just about everything a record needs to be taken seriously.
