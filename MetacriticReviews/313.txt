A rewarding art-pop risk. [Dec 2004, p.148]
	Morrison's predictably intelligent solo debut puts personality where the Dismemberment Plan's synergy used to be.
	A collection of enigmatic indie-rock tunes. [Nov 2004, p.119]
	Travistan is odd but oddly listenable, with a bright mood sparked by Morrison's spirit of discovery.
	Morrison is challenging expectations and listeners by stretching his musical boundaries and defying people to come along for the ride through close listening.
	After hearing the crap people have said about this album Im bummed that people are so quick to reject what doesnt fit their immediate logic. Its ironic that folks would get off on shredding an album thats about trying to be kind and honest at the same time.
	At worst, the wordy Travistan borders on hectoring... At his danceable best, Morrison ingeniously manifests his big concepts and even bigger heart. [Nov 2004, p.138]
	The album feels half baked, as though Morrison isn't quite sure which direction to take his nascent solo career.
	Instead of in-your-face intricacy and complex rhythms, Travistan displays a much more restrained complexity that doesn't jump up and down for attention; and replacing the innovative vocal lines are cloying melodies that never seem to end.
	The problem most people are going to make is taking the record too seriously, but even recognizing it as being overly tongue-in-cheek won't save it from being, at very best, painfully frustrating.
	This is just an awful display of gratuitous self-indulgence.
	Travistan fails so bizarrely that it's hard to guess what Morrison wanted to accomplish in the first place.
	There should be a new section in record stores for that god-awful Sgt. Pepper movie, Joe Pesci's Vincent Laguardia Gambini Sings Just for You, Jewel's book of poetry, and Travistan.
