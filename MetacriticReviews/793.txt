	Their charm wears thin with each passing track, and Stride's hit-making approach becomes increasingly plain in the process. In the end, it's something of a blessing that Everybody Wants to Be on TV is over and done with in a mere 34 minutes' time.
	It is full of catchy melodies and hooks. It is extraordinarily lame. Think of Keane, and remove the grit.
	With Everybody Wants To Be On TV, they've given those masses what they want. But there's nothing for the discerning music fan.
	40 minutes' worth of observations such as, "I'm a little bit lost without you/ I'm a bloody big mess inside" and "Posh girls have good manners/ But they go like the clappers" (ye gods), accompanied by roustabout guitar, drums and keyboards.
	The musical equivalent of a puppy humping your leg. This is not a recommendation.
	Because beneath the clownishly self-effacing exterior, there's an artless ambition at work here that's terrible to behold.
	They peddle clich√©s about ugly ducklings and shagging that are so offensive they make a donkey braying into a bin sound like the ripe observations of a Charlie Brooker column.
