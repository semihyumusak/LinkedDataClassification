Because of the emphasis on brevity and variety (and especially quality), the album's over before you know it and you're left feeling hungry for more Korn.
	Korn have circled the wagons and self-produced their best album to date, refining the formula to a black-cancer marmalade of corrosive riffs, fist-flying rhythms, gothic-carnival atmospheres and toxic vocals.
	All fine in principle, except we've heard it all a million times before.
	Korn are ultra-confident, forgoing the blandishments of heavy-rock virtuoso conceptualist Michael Beinhorn, who produced their last album. [Mar 2004, p.121]
	Unconvincing and safe. [Feb 2004, p.102]
	A brutal barrage of staccato beats, club-footed riffs and panzer-division stomps.
	[Korn] sound both out of focus and curiously out of date. [Feb 2004, p.95]
	Take A Look In The Mirror doesnt just sound like a bad album, it sounds like a broken record.
	Korn remain technically proficient, but Take A Look In The Mirror serves only to make the case that the genre has officially screamed itself into caricature. [12 Dec 2003, p.77]
