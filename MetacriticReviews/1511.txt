Andrew WK's lucid, luminous production delivers a sequence of music that seems to hover between states. This is a musical achievement. [Jun 2011, p.46]
	Baby Dee may be writing about slugs and snails, cowboys and pie, but she is a serious artist worthy of sincere consideration.
	This largely instrumental album is lush and joyful, roaming and sweeping across the ivories, one to which you can create a dramatic narrative of your own. [May 2011, p.79]
	The darkness of gender dysmorphia may indeed be vast, but given the right illuminating gift, Baby Dee proves there's still light nonetheless--even for hir own chamber music.
	Utilizing a pit band that includes percussion, melodica, pump organ, bassoon, cello, glockenspiel, tuba, and sousaphone, Regifted Light is largely instrumental, allowing listeners the pleasure of hearing Dee's artfully constructed melodies and arrangements, as well as her truly impressive ivory work, without the arguable distraction of her divisive, thespian-bred voice.
	Regifted Light doesn't seem built to shock or cajole, but to connect with all sorts of people, and to last.
	Dee's lyrics consistently reveal a formidable intelligence and a deep and deeply-felt cultural repertoire.
	The tonal similarities of these tracks blend into one another, holding only half of your attention like the soundtrack of an imagined film. [Apr 2011, p.105]
