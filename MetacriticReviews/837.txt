Shad's most recent album, 2010's TSOL, builds right where The Old Prince left off, and is even more impressive.
	Yes, he nails those internal rhymes. Nobody's Rakim. But he earns the brag.
	His delivery is just as smooth and his lyrics are as slyly clever as before. Shad continues to grow as an artist and has adjusted well to his newfound success. While the old prince no longer has to live at home, he shows true leadership skills in the ability to connect with listeners.
	It's never pretentious, showy, or fake-tough; it's just Shad, doing what he does, and it sounds earnestly great.
	It's creative, enlightening, and altogether fun.
	Shad's delivery and enunciation are impeccable. The only rewinds necessary are to catch lines like "hustle on the level of Barney Rubble on Red Bull." TSOL will no doubt give Shad the recognition he deserves.
	The result is both extremely rhythmically pleasing and a lyric sheet that rewards repeat listens, as it's impossible for everything to be caught right away
	Anyone with an appreciation for smartass MCs and a little of Fender-tapping would do well to give TSOL a spin. [Nov 2010, p.116]
	What Shad reveals of himself on TSOL is spiritual without being preachy, righteous without being self-righteous, and human without sounding mundane.
	His third album shows his mic skills to be only marginally above average--though given the right vintage soul groove he can raise his game. [Jan 2011, p.138]
