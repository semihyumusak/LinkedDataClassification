Lovely, heartbreaking, and just diffident enough to get perspective on this bittersweet old world. [26 Sep 2003, p.94]
	You won't hear a more humane, moving or mysterious record all year. [Album of the Month, Oct 2003, p.110]
	Those who want their Emmylou full of sweet, sad longing will play a quarter of this album to death.... Elsewhere, there's righteous anger and an assertiveness and sexuality to the love songs. [Nov 2003, p.128]
	She is still in the forefront of genre-transcending artistry.
	Even breezy pop songs like "Jupiter Rising" and timeless standards like "Plaisir D'Amour" gain profundity from Harris and [producer Malcolm] Burn's genteel approach.
	Unlike her recent work, Stumble Into Grace is made up solely of Harriss work--love songs like Can You Hear Me Now that perfectly suit her voice, which is sweet and whispery yet never sentimental.
	What's most heartening is that Harris is not only making some of the finest music of her career at a time when many artists would be treading water, but she's delightfully confounding our expectations at the same time.
	The poppier bits like Jupiter Rising don't always work, but the darkly gritty Time In Babylon, in particular, shows just how far Harris has pushed the traditional country sound. [Oct 2003, p.104]
	Grace includes lots of atmospheric touches that are two steps beyond country and miles too ethereal to call pop.
	Stumble Into Grace's saving grace, naturally, is Harris's voice, possessed of a mature poignancy that transcends pedestrian production; it's far too genuine an instrument for the lackluster arrangements offered here.
	Subtle exercises in pushing genre boundaries, these (mostly self-penned) songs deal in profundity without resort to cliche, and they deserve better than to have the life polished out of them.
