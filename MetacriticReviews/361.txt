It's a thing of subversive beauty, a striking debut that's self-assured and captivating. [Mar 2004, p.104]
	The poetry of pain is so strong, and mixed with superbly produced music that doesnt take a nanosecond for granted.
	Like a Postal Service for hippies living off the grid. [May 2004, p.108]
	Its ridiculously eclectic, yet uniformly affecting; a winter warmer that moves with a mysterious grace.
	Me First proves to be a remarkably consistent and memorable listen.
	Sennett twists and turns his songwriting more when he's alone than he does with Rilo Kiley, and while playing spot-the-influences isn't hard... it's also pointless in light of the album's genuine warmth.
	A discernibly West Coast-influenced affair, it's an album of anecdotal moments set to a glorious country-rock backdrop: graciously sun-kissed melodies, vocal harmonies, neat arrangements and refreshing, varied instrumentation.
	He may not be the first to mix the bucolic with the mechanic, and God knows he wont be the last, but here all the symptoms of overexposure sink under the unassuming grace of his gifts.
	The mournful harmonies and orchestral sweetening on some tracks... spread a seductively decadent sheen over the oddly uplifting proceedings. [27 Feb 2004, p.98]
	"Me First" may not be greater than the sum of its parts, but it certainly is equal to them, which is a lot. [1 Mar 2004]
	The overall sonic experiment succeeds, but the songs never quite attain the level of some of the band's influences.
	Me First is a Sunday record, a rainy-day record, a home-alone record, a lying-on-the-floor, staring-at-the-ceiling record.
	A casual, mostly charming sketchbook of diffident alt-country laments. [Mar 2004, p.116]
	Addresses the stained beauty of all things LA via psychedelic washes of keys, honking sax and country stomp. [May 2004, p.100]
	"Me First" is an easy listen, but Sennett is not nearly as captivating a leader as Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis, and the coming-of-age tunes aren't always strong enough to account for the album's lack of tempo change.
	Peppered with dissatisfying, mommy-daddy emotastic lyrics, Jeff Tweedy impressions, and Four Tet-inspired, stop-on-a-dime, into-something-totally-unrelated segues that don't really belong on a country-twinged "let's hang out, drink, and make a record, dudes" kind of affair.
