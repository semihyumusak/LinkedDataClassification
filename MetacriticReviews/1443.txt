Bright Yellow is the soundtrack for a small town, like New york, where everybody knows too much about everybody else. [May 2003, p.112]
	An album of uncommon intelligence.
	A summery pop journey, complete with mellow melodies and gentle guitars.
	Smart, sitting-room songcraft barbed with bright guitars. [21 Feb 2003, p.150]
	A lovely album, understated and tender, and indeed quite distinct from the angrier, more angular sound on Spring Hill Fair.
	A mature, elegant effort, full of richness and depth.
	Another treasure. [Mar 2003, p.95]
	Bright Yellow, Bright Orange is further proof that the second half of the Go-BetweensÂ’ career is one well worth following.
	This is one consistent record that will being a smile to your face; there is nothing breathtaking, but there doesn't have to be.
	An absolute masterclass in thoughtful, emotional songwriting. [Apr 2003, p.104]
	Go-Betweens fans should be very happy with Bright Yellow Bright Orange and glad the band has decided to stay together and continue to make smart, exciting adult pop music.
	It's every bit as essential as any of its predecessors; completely essential, in other words.
	A beautifully contained album, short in length and miniaturist in vision. [#14, p.135]
	Bright Yellow almost never reaches the highs of the group's classic early albums, nor does it embarrass itself by straining to duplicate them.
	Robert Forster's and Grant McLennan's distinctly different songwriting styles mesh brilliantly here.
	Bright Yellow Bright Orange is a much better album than Friends of Rachel Worth primarily because it largely abandons the formers' modern rock ambitions for a reflective and more natural folk-rock sound.
	Recalls the band's earliest days. [Apr 2003, p.74]
