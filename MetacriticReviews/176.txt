Sounds like a partnership ceremony between R.E.M. and the Magnetic Fields, with Phil Spector presiding. [Listen 2 This supplement, May 2003, p.25]
	As long as you are open, you will love this album. It will be as important to a lot of people as 'The Queen Is Dead'.
	With an open approach to queer sexuality and radical politics, The Smell of Our Own offers an alternative to the saccharine teen spirit we're so used to sniffing. It's a sensual celebration of stinky, real-life sexuality.
	Imagine if a Morrissey-style frontman--sharp, tender and taboo-breaking--was also sexual. [May 2003, p.107]
	More religious text and tapestry than commercial pop folk, The Smell of Our Own charts its own territory through the heart and head and holes of celebratory love. Truly unique.
	The album almost sounds like an original cast recording of a musical -- the next best thing to being there, but not the same by a long shot.
	It transcends gender and genre. [Apr 2003, p.98]
	The Cameras mix sex and spirituality over a gorgeous bed of organs, harps and 12-part harmonies. [May 2003, p.120]
	In the indie universe, rarely do groups making such live spectacles have albums to back up the show--but this charming, smart, lush pop is a notable exception. [June 2003, p.97]
	This is the stuff memorable summer days are made of.
	Gibbs passionate vocals and direct, literate lyrics work best when hes confronting issues that concern him (like organized religion, for instance), as opposed to wallowing in less confrontational topics (as when he frolics happily on the beach with Boys Of Melody).
	Gibb's mixture of gay and Christian imagery is potent, and his vision of music as a grand communal experience is backed up by some memorable tunes. [Apr 2003, p.112]
