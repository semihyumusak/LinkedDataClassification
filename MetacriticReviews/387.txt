Lound insanity is sexy; quiet insanity is sexier. [Sep 2003, p.118]
	A nuanced, ever-shifting masterwork that reveals its biggest rewards to the listener who's got 53 minutes to experience the whole thing, start to finish, and who's willing to do this several times.
	This record expects -- nay, demands -- multiple exposures. Its hidden delights and traps are equally patient.
	On a couple of tracks here he feels the need to introduce some lame house beats and equally passe drum'n'bass, which is a shame because the rest of the time he creates a vocabulary that's utterly his own. [Jun 2003, p.100]
	One of the most disturbing orchestral albums you'll hear.
	Anyone that expects the pulsating You Guys Kill Me would be better off sitting this one out, but Elliot has pulled off a tricky feat here: stripping down his sound to more orthodox "rock" instrumentation, without losing his edge.
	Disturbing, complicated, and enthrallingly strange, The Mess We Made requires patience, and, ideally, an already established taste for Elliott's previous ambient output.
	Delicacy replaces density here, but his capacity to unnerve remains on these sedately mournful chamber pieces. [#231, p.74]
	This music sounds a lot like something Edward Scissorhands might compose if he could just play the damn piano.
	The abject despair of The Mess We Made can become tedious, and, more than most artists, Elliott depends on a listener who is willing forgive him his lack of subtlety.
	An LP of spooked delicacy and wheezy, wayward charm. [Jun 2003, p.104]
