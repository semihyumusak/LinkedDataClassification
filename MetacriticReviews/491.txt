This is adult contemporary music that's enough fun for the kids and true-blue country without any trace of flag-waving or bigotry.
	Love on the Inside, the third CD from the duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, is, in part, a welcome return to that kind of bygone lyricism, where songs that hooked into the details of human foible and frailty could flourish.
	Throughout Love on the Inside, Nettles and Bush trick out their twangy tunes with shiny new-wave guitars, creamy pop harmonies, and robust rock beats.
	While this set is saturated with hunger and ambition, it's also confident and sophisticated--the album sounds as if they meant every word but had a great time making it.
	Sugarland's third album, finely crafted with producer Byron Gallimore, is proof positive that singer/songwriters Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush are on the cusp of superstardom.
	Now and then, the energy lags. But mostly, Sugarlandâ€™s shameless mining of VH1 Classic hooks keeps their more tepid tendencies in check.
	The Atlanta pair's third album, Love on the Inside, adheres to the musical method on which the act has feasted to date, and adds occasional fresh wrinkles to its buoyant, pop-laced country.
	They use showmanship more than manufactured sincerity to do so, but they do it well.
	What gives the duo character and what salvages the album, then, are frontwoman Jennifer Nettles's performances and a handful of cuts that rise above the middlebrow songwriting and production.
