He still comes across much of the time like a less charismatic Nelly.
	If anything, Chingy has regressed since his debut, and his initially fresh style now sounds old.
	The most memorable songs on his third album are decidedly buzz killers. [Oct 2006, p.96]
	Mostly he just sounds bored, a pretty boy tired of being denied his inner turmoil.
	The best production can't hide Hoodstar's lack of imagination. [22 Sep 2006, p.95]
	Hoodstar only makes it all the more apparent that the St. Louis MC's overnight popularity was like lightning in a bottle.
	Aside from a few catchy club tracks, there is nothing all that exciting about Chingy's third album.
	Generally, Chingy is blank, as flat as tap water. [Oct 2006, p.150]
	The majority of tracks scream "poor old bored celeb." [Nov 2006, p.139]
	Chingy is the least interesting part of his own songs.
	Chingy just doesnâ€™t have the charisma, or the skills, or even the production team necessary to make him at all interesting, much less enjoyable.
