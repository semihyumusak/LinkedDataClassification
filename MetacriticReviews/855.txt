Watershed marks a new chapter for Opeth, one that promises infinitely more than its predecessors.
	It’s their most crucial album since 1999’s stunning "Still Life," and its title could not be more appropriate.
	If anything, the group's latest is another musical masterpiece from a band known for putting out musical masterpieces.
	Prog was rarely as songful as the brutal beauty here.
	A substantial addition to the band's catalog.
	Watershed, the new Opeth album, broad enough to encompass death-metal pummeling as well as cello and English horn, is typically engrossing--symphonic, and in a way organic.
	Patience, persistence and a good set of headphones will uncover fragile melodies here amid the maelstrom, though the guitar noodling can veer dangerously close to Mark Knopfler territory. [July 2008, p.101]
	Watershed has friction, and friction brings heat. Those left cold by metal's po-faced tendencies might well warm up to it.
	What Opeth do best is flat-out shred, and at its finest moments, Watershed howls like the unholy union of Queensryche, Yngwie Malmsteen and Morbid Angel. [Aug 2008, p.166]
	Growls and blast-beats come decorated with guitar work that explores scale after scale of diabolical pleasures. [Aug 2008, p.101]
