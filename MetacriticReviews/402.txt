Chirping their expertly executed tunes, scorning the guitar swagger good old boys think makes them so sexy, they're a pop cartoon worth more than gold.
	At a lean 30 minutes, Hell On Heels is too slight to deliver completely on the trio's promise, but the sense of fun and sisterly affection that pervades the album makes it a winning opening salvo from an intriguing new group.
	With any luck, Pistol Annies is not a one-off for the trio, but rather a regular gig: this is too much pure fun to not repeat.
	None of this would work if the songs weren't actually good, but they're frequently brilliant.
	It's heartbreaking and hilarious, in equal measure.
	The album's bluesy country sound may not make waves at radio, but these ladies are on track to give country concertgoers a little hell of their own.
	Hell on Heels is one beautiful amble.
	The songs have the feeling of rejuvenative writing, small experiments in genre and style for artists versed in country's classic modes but who rarely get to fiddle around with them.
	The production is clean and not overly slick but the memorable hooks with sweet harmonies come fast and often, resulting in a relatively subtle set that at just 30 minutes leaves you wanting more.
