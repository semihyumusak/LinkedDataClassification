The disc's first single, "Someone Else Not Me," makes it clear that although the band often sticks to the same songwriting formula, there are still new melodies left to explore.
	Pop Trash proves to be far from embarrassing...
	Pop Trash plays out with a quiet, digestible ease that stays firmly grounded in the comfort zone they have managed to create for themselves.
	The pleasant surprise is that, after all the personnel changes, Duran Duran still has its characteristic sound and charisma...
	The well-named Pop Trash shows off their jaded hooks and nasty wit; it's for fans only, but those of us who still crumple at the opening hiccups of "Hungry Like the Wolf" will be glad for another fix.
	There are ephemeral confectionary delights...and a general witlessness-
	Some of the smooth, spacey ballads that were characteristic of their 1993 self-titled release show up here, but more often than not LeBon is lost in a swamp of over-production.
	A mediocre Britpop album.
	Most of the album is, in fact, pop trash.
