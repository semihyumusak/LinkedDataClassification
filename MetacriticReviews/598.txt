The Town and the City isn't likely to be the soundtrack for your next party, but it's an exciting and emotionally powerful experience that grows with each listen.
	A tour de force of intertwined sound and imagery. [Oct 2006, p.117]
	This is an album in the classic, pre-digital sense, in which the very sequence of songs suggests meaning and connection. [12 Sep 2006]
	Its stories of survivors and struggling lovers have a wistfulness that spills from the lyrics into the tone of David Hidalgo’s vocal performances and the warm guitar lines, which draw on blues, classic rock, and traditional Mexican musical flourishes.
	Los Lobos sound fresher, more invigorated, and weirder than they have in years.
	What Los Lobos's thirteenth long-player lacks in surprise it makes up for in groove and mood. [Oct 2006, p.103]
	Review #1: Stands as one of the band’s best efforts. [score=70]; Review #2: The Town and the City is just as tight and adventurous as anything else coming out this year. [score=90]
	Los Lobos has swerved away from the upbeat music it plays on the jam-band circuit, harking back to its quietly startling 1992 album, “Kiko.” [25 Sep 2006]
	Los Lobos' best album since 1996's Colossal Head.
	Their first protest record. [Oct 2006, p.137]
