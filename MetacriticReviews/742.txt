The artist's familiar smoky vocals and the consistently rich production draw the listener in on his latest release, "Get Off on the Pain."
	Allan had a hand in co-writing five of the songs on Get Off on the Pain, which will likely go down as one of the best albums of his career.
	There’s several superlatives that could embellish Get Off on the Pain: contender for year’s end best of list, insightful and rare look into a singer’s psyche, a collection of top-grade Country music or soulful purging. All of them apply, and then some.
	The material explores a broader range of complex and wrenching emotions, and it marks the most consistent set of songs Allan has yet recorded.
	Get Off on the Pain is the year’s best country album so far, almost as brilliantly anguished as Mr. Allan’s 2003 masterpiece, “See if I Care.”
