Beaus$Eros is an interesting experiment. Busdriver is capable, obviously, in multiple genres, and has the restless, omnivorous kind of creativity that sees links between disparate styles.
	Not every song/experiment sticks, but there's enough sheer courage and musical inventiveness to merit back-to-back listens (and alienate swaths of hip-hop purists).
	A crooning Busdriver is frequently more intelligible, revealing his sense of humor and beauty. [Mar 2012, p.94]
	The production on the album is a very wide spectrum that still manages to feel cohesive.
	More quickly than you'd expect, Busdriver's quirks become endearing; his cartoonish vocal stretches to reach those high notes become normalised and you begin to appreciate how much heart he puts into his singing.
	Beaus$Eros yields some positive results while laying the foundation for some interesting future projects.
	Beaus$Eros is fringe listening.
	Like Zappa, Busdriver's creativity means that for every brilliant track he records there will be several tracks that are just plain weird, and Beaus$Eros is no exception.
	Beaus$Eros seems to re-hash the sonic aesthetic of Busdriver's earlier releases, but this time with less impressive beats, weak vocals, and little to no live instrumentation.
	An oddball experimental pop record... Cheers for sticking with a concept, just a bummer it didn't add up to its aspirations. [Mar 2012, p.88]
	While Beaus$Eros retains his playfulness and wordplay, and while the songs are without doubt catchy, Farquhar is out of his depth.
