J.Lo has a feisty, damn-I-know-I'm-all-that attitude, combined with pulsating, insistent beats that leap out of the speakers and make you wanna move.
	As a singer, J.Lo sounds more confident, as she takes more chances with a voice that is technically limited but well-suited to the material she handles.
	She's little more than an ex-Fly Girl with a bunch of studio tricks to help kick off the party.
	Essentially, this is the same album as On the Six, only a little longer with a little less focus and not as many memorable songs. This lack of winning singles becomes a drag, since at over an hour, the record meanders much longer than it should.
	Most of the songs on J.Lo, for all their craftsmanship, are easy to trace to last year's hits. And while dance pop doesn't necessarily demand great singers, Lopez is just scraping by.
	Lopez mostly sticks to a successful formula - R&B lite with a Latin touch.
	She's giving us déjà vu all over and over and over again by basically sticking to the same set of sonic templates throughout the 15-track album, never making much effort to shift up the tempos, melodies, and structures.
	Consistently aims for the lowest common denominator...
	Sure, 'J.Lo' is competent, but like Lopez's voice, it lacks sincerity and warmth.
	Her vocals are so mannered, self-conscious, and limited, there is no way to gloss over the facts, except when booming dance grooves rule the mix.
	It's the continual indulgence of Lopez's Gloria Estefan ambitions with various generic Latin tracks, completely at odds with everything else, that really grates.
