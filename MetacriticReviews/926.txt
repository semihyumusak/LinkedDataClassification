If it's an album that also argues that the band is working from formula, it's one they'd be wise to patent.
	Musically, Everclear sound almost exactly the same as when they signed with Capitol in 1995: punk, profoundly polished. But the details Alexakis sprinkles into the mix keep things interesting. [Apr 2003, p.102]
	On Slow Motion Daydream Everclear proves that it's still quite capable of delivering solid, rocking songs with memorable hooks, and frontman Art Alexakis still has plenty to say.
	Slow Motion Daydream isn't the knockout return to form it might have been, but it's significantly better than might be expected from the first impression its miserable single creates.
	Mellow moments abound, with gentle strings and pseudofolky melodies seeping into the mix, but most songs bank on the winsome charisma of the chunky guitars and Alexakis' grief-tinged Northwestern drawl, both of which manage to sound simultaneously cathartic and hook-y.
	While Slow Motion Daydream isn't quite as fresh as Everclear sounded on their 1994 debut Sparkle and Fade, a close listen reveals an entirely new layer of angst and existential dread that Alexakis and company have added to their repertoire.
	Consolidates the strengths and weaknesses of the American Movie one disc.
	Mostly, though, this is vintage mid-'90s Everclear. [#15, p.122]
	Attempts to obscure the paucity of decent songs with endless guitar wittering. [Apr 2003, p.102]
	Despite the fact that nobody bought their lackluster last two albums, Art Alexakis and his two lackeys are back with the even more banal and unnecessarily loud Slow Motion Daydream.
	They don't stray from what they know and they don't tarry from their blueprint. It's just that they don't know much and their blueprint was done in crayon. [#5, p.92]
	The band has never seemed so stale. [14 Mar 2003, p.66]
	Slow Motion Daydream is a real treat for Everclear fans since it's just a continuation of the Everclear sound, even if that sound is contrived and average.
	Mostly consists of generic rock, the sparkling production wiping clean any trace of roughness or originality in the groupÂ’s sound.
