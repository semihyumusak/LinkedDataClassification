Built on acoustic guitars with little splashes of color like handclaps, tooting horn sections, and subtle strings, the record sounds remarkably large in its smallness.
	A beautifully wrought collection of ballads for the brokenhearted. [#11, p.96]
	It's definitely nothing like the laid-back experience of listening to him live, but it's his best album yet.
	The slowly picked guitar, the detailed songwriting, the harmonica and the intriguing, plain-spoken lyrics are all here. [#64, p.96]
	Chances are it'll grow on ya.
	Like a technology-phobic Beck, Desser tells his off-kilter tales with a wry eye. [Sep 2004, p.119]
	Hayden's delicate little songs are potent, precious things indeed. [Oct 2004, p.110]
	Hayden's nagging melodies and deadpan delivery occupy their own peculiar kingdom. [Sep 2004, p.102]
	Review 1: A fulfilling collection of songs that can be enjoyed start to finish. [score=80]; Review 2: An album that seems overlong and out of focus. [score=60]
	The overarching narrative structure and sequencing make this album a well-conceived exercise in storytelling.
	Elk-Lake is a benign, restful listen, showing a once-unwieldy, always-vibrant creative mind having found a peaceful medium. While it's easy to appreciate the man's development, this blunted songwriting is somewhat less resonant-- and seems somehow less Hayden.
	Although most of the songs are good individually, the record is fairly monochromatic, and it can get a bit tiresome listening to it from start to finish.
	The lyrics and musicianship are of the quality to be expected from Hayden, but somethingÂ’s a little... boring about Elk Lake Serenade.
	Although the record is saved from complete disaster with its musical accompaniments... Elk-Lake Serenade is outrageously lonely and cumbersome.
