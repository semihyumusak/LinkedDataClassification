This [is] all the Kraftwerk you need, if you didn't need all the Kraftwerk ever made. [Jul/Aug 2005, p.106]
	As a career overview Minimum-Maximum far surpasses The Mix. This record's "importance" in the Kraftwerk story is up for debate, but there's no question it's a hell of a lot of fun.
	Emphatically validates just how fresh and alive Kraftwerk’s heavily manipulated compositions sound.
	Nearly everything on Minimum-Maximum sounds astoundingly fresh.
	Cut, copy and paste this definitive record into your world. [Jul 2005, p.115]
	Magnificent. [Jul 2005, p.100]
	Not just for followers, Minimum-Maximum is perfect for the old-school, drawing a new crowd of robot poppers and maybe convert a few disbelievers.
	As you’d expect from a band as clockwork tight and renowned for perfectionism as Kraftwerk, the quality of sound and precision of delivery is so spot-on as to be worthy of a studio recording.
	One of the best live albums that NME has ever heard.
	Minimum Maximum is the sound of Kraftwerk shedding all previous skins and staking their claim on the now. [Jul 2005, p.106]
	This is really a missing Greatest Hits in disguise. [Jul 2005, p.118]
	Kraftwerk still sounds great.
	Attest[s] to the group's pummeling might off vinyl. [#16, p.87]
	Sound-wise, the music is reminiscent of the sleek electronic architecture of 1986's Electric Café, while the tracks differ from their previously known versions mainly in featuring cleaner, punchier digital sounds.
	Visuals are such a crucial aspect of their performances that the set will naturally fall short of making you feel as if you are there.
	Minimum-Maximum is essentially a greatest-hits album with an audience applauding and occasionally shouting.
	So what's the problem? It's too, uh, perfect.
