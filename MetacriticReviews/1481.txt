As fine as anything he's done, but overall Grand Champ makes too many R&B concessions to be a fitting epitaph to his record-breaking career. [Nov 2003, p.129]
	A forceful march through familiar territory.
	His big voice and big, good-vs-evil themes  now need the gold lame beats of Grand Champ to deliver one last howling high.
	His most relentlessly aggressive album yet. [Oct 2003, p.119]
	When the hooks fall off, his lone-gunman purging becomes more tiring than cathartic. [Dec 2003, p.128]
	Too little stands out to make Grand Champ more than an uneven contender.
	Not quite the big comeback DMX needed at this point in his quietly sagging rap career, Grand Champ regardless has its share of highlights.
	Grand Champ would make a great single. As it stands, it's about a full hour more of DMX hollering gruffly than anybody really needs.
	The X-Man's grating lyrical redundancy throughout this disc reeks of laziness, and his self-derivative hooks and beats hints at complacency and stunted growth. [3 Oct 2003, p.73]
	Now we see. It is all clear. DMX believes what they say in Def Jam board meetings. He actually believes that what Mr Budden and Just Blaze did earlier this year is what one should do in hip-hop right now - meaning, shout popular thug slogans over irritatingly OTT beats for an hour or so.
	There's plenty here to test the patience of even the sternest fan. [Dec 2003, p.122]
	It's a selfish record, a me-first record, a record that exists purely to make DMX feel like a tough guy.
