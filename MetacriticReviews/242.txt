Flash and his collaborators provide good beats and rhymes so if this is what a "studio album" is for Flash in 2009 let's just hope there are plenty more on the way.
	While beats like 'Shine All Day's' electronic bounce feel odd at first, they gradually begin to make sense, while KRS-One's 'What If?' and the Supernatural-helmed 'Tribute To The Breakdancer' will keep the most ardent old-schoooler happy. [Apr 2009, p.108]
	The Bridge is undoubtedly well-produced and nearly every guest emcee puts forth respectable effort, but the whole album is missing that one song that could take it to the next level.
	Truly, though, I like to think that The Bridge takes the best of early- to mid-’90s hip-hop from New York, the synthesized sound of the last five to ten years, an interesting blend of MCs, and an ear for a slammin’ beat, and puts them together in a package that isn’t necessarily mind-blowing, but that is at least complete, well-intended, and meaningful.
	Overall, The Bridge has a very Reagan-era vibe, and not just due to appearances by KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane.
	The album's ersatz old school mode inevitably pales when judged against the revolutionary Flash asides. [Mar 2009, p86]
	Only the stripped-down electro of 'Here Comes My DJ' shows anything like his old form. [Apr 2009, p.105]
	The production of The Bridge sounds like it came out of an extended catch-up session, the work of a man best accustomed to the breakbeat era's techniques trying his hand at the last ten years' worth of club-rap digitalism.
