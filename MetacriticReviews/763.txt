Iconoclastic and visceral, Squarepusher is punk rock 2002. [Nov 2002, p.132]
	His most diverse collection of songs to date.
	Fans of Squarepusher's trademark schizophrenic d'n'b beats will enjoy the title cut.... Other tracks completely disintegrate into severe experimentalism, changing from music to art-sound installations. [Oct 2002, p.81]
	[The live disc is] arguably far more interesting and focused and energized than the studio effort.
	An often fascinating, if frustratingly uneven record.
	Another befuddling album that offers what seems to be a gigantic middle finger bookended by disrupted toe-tappy pop numbers. [Oct 2002, p.96]
	Though the focus on range and experimentation is fascinating for those who've already heard Squarepusher doing the standard drill'n'bass rigamarole, the randomness evident on productions like "Kill Robok" makes the LP about as infectious as a surgical bandage.
	Somewhat of a Squarepusher overview: digitally diced, partially digested, and sometimes brutally regurgitated, of course.
	Rather good fun. [Nov 2002, p.116]
	A couple of the tracks have a very strange motionless ambience, and others initially seem like failed attempts at post-jungle. And I'm ashamed to say that the final track, a remix/cover of "Love Will Tear Us Apart", is actually without a soul.
	The album's only worthwhile moment [is] the title track, which has already become a concert fave for fans.
	This wouldn't be a Squarepusher record if it didn't flip the bird to listeners at some point. [#10, p.126]
	For completeists only.
