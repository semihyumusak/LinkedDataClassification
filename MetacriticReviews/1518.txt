Who else but Madness could pull off covers of the Supremes and the Kinks on the same record? [#17, p.94]
	Sessions is loose and fun and, while not blazing any trails, it doesn't sound like a bad karaoke night either.
	A dandy little party record. [19 Aug 2005, p.143]
	Many of these songs are a delight to listen to; most could easily be a single.

	Whilst back then they bounced along with cheekiness and zeal, now they seem to be trying to continue the reggae-meets-Brit-suburbia Nutty blueprint but end up falling flat in too many places.

	If you didn't know what the band have been capable of, this would be good enough. [Aug 2005, p.94]
