An early frontrunner for the UK album of the year.
	This is big, epic, widescreen music, albeit wonderfully understated. [5 Mar 2005, p.51]
	Songwriting necessarily takes a backseat here most of the time, but it’s hardly missed when there’s so much gorgeous, woozy texture to loll in.
	This transcendent debut is the real stoner rock. [Aug 2005, p.103]
	An incredibly warm and organic sounding debut.
	Music of stark, placid beauty. [Apr 2005, p.121]
	What sets Engineers apart on this full-length debut is their ability to build up a strong sound without anything being lost within it. [#9]
	Beautiful. [Apr 2005, p.108]
	Equal parts drawn-out and dreamy. [#16, p.97]
	This album's exceptional, for as familiar and generic as it sounds, there is an autumnal sort of charm.
	This is what the new Coldplay album should have been.
	Their gentle approach is justified by the fact that their songs are quite memorable, written with a sense of grandeur and astral beauty.
	Engineers here prove capable both of emotive songwriting and of virtuoso studio craft.... Yet it falls shorts of true brilliance, for the simple reason that the band steadfastly refuse to rock-out.
	It's a warm and welcoming experience all round, and very much the mark of a band that know exactly what they're doing even if they sound remarkably out of step with everyone else.
	Derivative as it may be, it's done so well that it's awfully hard to bash.
	"One In Seven" is the best song on the London-based four-piece Engineers' self-titled long player.... The problem: "One In Seven" is the last song on the album. The ten tracks preceding it simply don’t measure up.
	Engineers is a promising if frequently innocuous first time out, with its excellent production and musicianship bogged down by weak-kneed songwriting and idiotic sequencing.
	[Most] of the album just sort of swirls through some nicely-produced, but ultimately not very engaging sonic fluff.
