Let's face it, no one else today is making music as cool and original as that of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
	The brittle treble-heavy assault is replaced with clarity, greater exploration of texture and more "professional" recording.
	The Machine EP is a bizarre experiment for the YYYs: is this studio-glazed rocker the one that will show their true colors - or is this just a little endeavor to see what they can pull off? Either way, IÂ’m pretty pissed.
	Machine disappoints on an almost unprecedented number of levels, and its unfortunate length is the least of its problems.
