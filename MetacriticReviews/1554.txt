More often than not, though, Flashy is lots of cleverly dumb fun.
	Much of the record satirizes plastic surgery and oversexed macho men, but despite the ironic humor, there’s a compassion in the music that’s unexpected coming from a band best known for a Taco Bell–referencing novelty hit.
	No, the Electric Six haven’t crafted a masterpiece, but each new disc shows them evolving and developing into one of the most reliably consistent rock groups out there today.
	Reborn, the track leads off the sardonic sextet’s fifth album of apocalyptic buffoonery shot through with metal, new wave and disco, all of it hilarious, none of it a joke.
	True to its title, Flashy is heavy on sheen, and bombast that blinds like glitter on a dirty bar floor. [Year End 2008, p.82]
	The world only needed one Electric Six album, but for a few understated moments, this one makes the case for a second.
	Flashy, the Detroit band's fifth full-length, still executes garage-glam with senses fully heightened, but it seems totally uninterested in doing anything new.
