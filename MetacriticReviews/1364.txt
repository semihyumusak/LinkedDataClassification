Gorgeous and intimate, the 14 songs on her debut disc ache with romantic maturity and a smart, slow-jam sexiness that belies the fact that, at 22, Jones is hardly older than Britney.
	Her voice is supple and precise, her touch on piano lovely.
	A showcase for Jones' remarkable voice, the disc captures a singer whose rare instinct for interpretation always serves the song, rather than working against it.
	She has created a complete, original style that straddles multiple musical genres.
	While the mood of this record stagnates after a few songs, it does give a strong indication of Jones' alluring talents.
	Her readings of the Hank Williams classic, "Cold Cold Heart" and Hoagy Carmichael's "The Nearness of You" alone are worth the price of the CD.
	Inevitably, it all starts to grow a little samey.
	She sings in an earthy growl that can send chills, or a conspiratorial whisper that suggests she's sharing sworn secrets, or a weary sigh that exudes the kind of quiet, easygoing intimacy that doesn't come around in songs too much anymore.
	There's a seductive quality to the simple yet sophisticated and intimate ambience Jones creates with this music.
