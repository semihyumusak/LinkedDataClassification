Mink Car will please just about all but the most picky of They Might Be Giants fans. Diverse, off-beat, strange, fun, and decidedly wonderful, it proves that TMBG haven't really lost anything over the years...
	It's all funny, but also wise in a way.
	The majority of the new songs are keepers.
	They Might Be Giants are just a stitch more serious about being silly, and that extra earnestness makes all the difference.
	They haven't lost any of their quirky cool mojo. [Nov 2001, p.97]
	Mink Car is all over the map, an ideal piece of entertainment for listeners simultaneously blessed and cursed with high IQs and attention deficit disorder.
	Almost a total wreck -- even decent melodies are hard to come by. [Aug/Sep 2001, p.130]
	Mink Car is all been-there-done-that. [#11]
	Yes, Mink Car is crap. All the charms They Might Be Giants once seemed to possess have dissipated into a cloud of embarrassing awkwardness.
