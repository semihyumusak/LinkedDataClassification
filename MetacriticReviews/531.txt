The writing is just as rueful, darkly romantic, and exuberant as it's ever been. [16 May 2003, p.72]
	Thompson is more comfortable than ever with his musical abilities and songwriting craft, and you hear the experience and the confidence on every track.
	The album feels like a romp, with Thompson performing everything from delicate waltzes to roadhouse rock.
	Fortunately, this spare approach serves Thompson well because he's such a strong and varied songwriter plus a remarkably distinctive guitarist.
	Of the nearly 59 minutes of music here, about 40 induce deep pleasure. [#16, p.125]
	A significant return to form. [Feb 2003, p.86]
	The Old Kit Bag is Richard Thompson's simplest and most unadorned album since Shoot Out the Lights, and while it isn't an immediate masterpiece like that album, it confirms that this man's work is best presented at its simplest, and the result is a modest triumph.
	Newcomers will be shocked by his natural ability and old-time fans will just nod the same knowing appreciation and file the album next to the ever-growing mass of excellent if unspectacular releases.
	As the disc turns down one shadowy corner of the soul after another, it's hard not to wish that the witty, romantic, storytelling Thompson would show up to give the other guy a break, at least for a song or two.
	Thompson's taut, literary folk pop is as odd and pleasing as ever.
	Doesn't quite make it into the Thompson solo Top 10.... But it's good to have him back. [Mar 2003, p.102]
