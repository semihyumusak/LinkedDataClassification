Both exhilaratingly rocking and gorgeously pensive. [Nov 2005, p.210]
	The best record of his career, a collision of the idiosyncratic charms of Portastatic with the exuberant rock power of Superchunk.
	Spine-tinglingly great.
	More than the sound, the words of Bright Ideas are especially important; they are not particularly eloquent, but they are representative something larger: each clumsy, unsure expression desperately needs to be said.
	While the batch he's cooked up on his the latest LP... stays true to the songwriting formula that has gained him over a decade of accolades, "Bright Ideas" does, in fact, find McCaughan at his most sonically expansive to date.
	As good as Bright Ideas is, though, I still can't recommend it over say, the last Superchunk record.
	The songs are reliably mid-tempo and catchy, although they certainly lack the heedless rush that made the first Superchunk albums such models of indie rock.
	Bright Ideas has an air of excitement and energy about it, and contains some of McCaughan's strongest songwriting to date.
	Every track here is strong.... Portastatic's best yet. [Oct/Nov 2005, p.122]
	On par with anything in the back catalog. [#69, p.106]
	Bright Ideas sounds pretty much like a decent, later-period Superchunk record.
	Bright Ideas is more pleasant than kick-ass or inspired. But for an album this deep into his career, at a time when he could start growing aesthetically antsy, McCaughan sticks to a blueprint that works best.
	At ten tracks, Bright Ideas doesnâ€™t have a lot of fat, but it ultimately feels like it could have been more successful on the EP format McCaughan is so fond of.
	Portastatic is exactly as advertised: catchy, sometimes dumb, occasionally rockin', but always at least competent pop.
	While McCaughan retains a lot of his vitality, he can't completely shake off the specter of comfortable maturity. [#11, p.116]
