The Hives explode where a hundred other punk bands are proud to rock.
	Veni Vidi Vicious literally explodes with frenetic guitar jangle and audacious hooks.
	Plenty of fuzzed, struttin', propulsive guitar work on this disc to assault your ears.
	Those dependable fuzz tones never get tired, so long as they're accompanied by a propulsive backbeat, maximum adrenaline and a modicum of melody, and Sweden's Hives have all of that.
	Vicious is a combination of punk's snottiness, Detroit rock's raw power and the stylized blues freak-outs of bands like Pussy Galore.
	While brevity alone isn't automatically a virtue, the songs here contain enough ample surprises, and hidden rewards, that there's nothing lacking even as the Hives smartly employ the logic of "always leave them wanting more."
	Their propulsive intensity busts down garage doors, stumbling only with the wrongheaded ersatz cocktail ballad. [#8, p.117]
	They came, they saw, they rocked viciously. [Jul. 2002, p.82]
	The Hives seem to have approached Vicious with one aim in mind: to rock Â– hard -- for 27 minutes straight. Even more impressively, they actually pull it off.
	On Veni Vidi Vicious, the band plays like rascals on their way to jail, with the prospect of conjugal visits depending on the music's extroverted energy.
	They almost vindicate the near-deafening hoopla that preceded this major-label debut. [10 May 2002, p.80]
	Instead of coming from noise and chaos, they're rooted in pastiche and show business-- especially on their one midtempo song, the 50s pop knockoff "Find Another Girl." Your parents might dig this album as much as you do.
	The Hives' brand of neo-garage leans heavy on punk and lacks nuance, but the unification of speed, volume, and shake generates a scalding steam.
