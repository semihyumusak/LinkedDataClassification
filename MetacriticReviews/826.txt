A series of sparse ruminations on barren landscapes and cosmic coincidence that comprises weird sound effects, acoustic finger-picking, tape loops and spectral vocal incantations. [Apr 2005, p.118]
	School of the Flower easily ranks as Ben Chasny's best work thus far.
	Whether you’re a newcomer to Chasny’s sublime psychedelic folk or were a fan from the get-go and own all the limited editon vinyl, no one could possibly be disappointed with this album.
	It is a beautiful result that, through the austere and effortlessly enchanting tunes, leaves you feeling the emotion infinitely more than any self-professed ‘emo’ might.
	Their most beautifully conceived and ambitiously extended work to date. [#252, p.59]
	His strongest, most satisfying effort to date.
	A gorgeous little nightmare.
	It is full of emotion yet never sophomoric, it is full of aural poetry and never pretentious, and it is full of that certain mercurial grace that makes each new offering from Six Organs of Admittance something wholly other and an essential listen.
	As eclectic as Chasny’s influences may be, there isn’t much here that would sound out of place to underground rock fans.
	He reins in some of his rougher edges, offering listeners a more streamlined sound.
	It makes a stunning case for a silent nod of the head: sometimes it’s good enough to enjoy an album, taking it take it all in as it comes, without attempting to articulate its majesty.
	A record for the creeping darkness of a hot summer night in which the night seems to last forever and the heat, the same.
	It's essentially easy listening for uneasy people. [Mar 2005, p.101]
	School of the Flower is as pretty as its titular place of higher learning intimates and as substantive as bongsmoke.
	Your senses will be sorely disappointed.
