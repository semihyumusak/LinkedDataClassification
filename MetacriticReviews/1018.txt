31 Minutes' breezy B-boy anthems may keep the man of the half hour around well past Labor Day.
	He sounds as unflappable as the subject of his first hit.
	The better surprise is his heavy dose of talent that doesn't necessarily dazzle but does charm, and is deep enough to keep things interesting for a whole album.
	Think Justin Timberlake's less-talented cousin, or Andy Samberg.
	Posner's B-boy sound may be derivative as hell, but the album stands to turn him into the latest DIY sensation.
	Mike Posner is at the head of a new genre: frat-house R&B.
	This short, lightweight disc finds Posner evolving from his hip-hop leaning early mixtapes into a nasal-voiced talk-singer with some serious woman issues. Mostly, though (unlike, say, Kid Cudi), his lyrics barely scratch the surface of real emotions.
	He toggles between petulant cad ("Gone in September") and wounded child ("Save Your Goodbye"), convincing at neither. He has a grating voice, heavily nasal, with a seeming inability to wrap his lips around all of the necessary syllables, meaning that even when he's at his angriest, he sounds as if he's holding back.
