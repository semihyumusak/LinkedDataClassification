There's no crybaby posing here, no deployment of clich√©. Even if SDRE had a hand in the popularization of the emo movement, the Fire Theft's music is much too personal to be anything other than a therapy session, both for Enigk and his musical co-conspirators and friends.
	Old fans may dislike their classic-rock ambition and orchestral gloss, but the Fire Theft could be the rare spin-off that equals its progenitor. [10 Oct 2003, p.124]
	A vast, often splendid affair that recalls the lavish expanse of Roger Waters-era Pink Floyd alongside the psychedelic crash of The Who. [Dec 2003, p.122]
	Some of the most grandiose music this side of ELO. [#8, p.108]
	Yes, it sounds like Yes, and, no, I don't mean that in a good way. [Nov 2003, p.99]
	Hard rock that is neither hard nor rock.
	By trying to apply big rock riffs and 1970s prog structures to Enigk's bare and vulnerable style, the Fire Theft seem to be struggling for a new sound.
	Too much of the edge is gone, too much emphasis is placed on guitar solos, and the guitars sound, at times, rather flat and listless.
	The passion that once seeped from the group now appears manufactured.
	A prog-rock field trip that will give Diary fans something (else) to cry about. [Dec 2003, p.128]
	Unfortunately, The Fire Theft actually sees the band indulging in ersatz approximations of Yes and Genesis' epic odysseys much more deeply.
	Oddly formless and forgettable, The Fire Theft finds Sunny Day Real Estate diminished in more ways than one.
