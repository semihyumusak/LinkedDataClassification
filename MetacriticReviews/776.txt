This is a very good record. I personally dare the “ASHLEE SUX” folks reading this to give it a reasonably objective spin.
	With constant acknowledgement of imperfections, Simpson separates herself from the peppy Lindsay Lohans and Hilary Duffs. [22 Oct 2005]
	The pop hooks are there, but we can't shake the feeling that the sentiments come off as phony.
	I Am Me isn't half bad--but it's only half good.
	If this fluffy, punk-lite petulance, devoid of any real personality is to your taste, lap it up.
	Every song feels like a retread of some hit you've heard before, somewhere. [21 Oct 2005, p.73]
	No matter how hard Simpson tries, no matter how foreboding the surface, beneath it all she's still light and frivolous. But that doesn't mean, by any stretch, that this is bubblegum music, since that term implies that this music is frothy, fun, and, most important, hooky, and I Am Me is none of those things.
	Sadly, this follow-up shows signs of premature ageing. [Mar 2006, p.109]
	Her singing is not convincing in the least. [16 Oct 2005]
	In venturing to offer something for everyone, Simpson offers nothing for anyone.
	"I Am Me" has an awful lot of brooding teen-rock songs, none of which flatter Ms. Simpson's rather breathy, mannered voice. [24 Oct 2005]
	The songs are soggier, the sentiments more banal. [Dec 2005, p.154]
	Her sense of self-importance [is] so prevalent on her second album that it negates the mild pleasure you might otherwise get from it.
