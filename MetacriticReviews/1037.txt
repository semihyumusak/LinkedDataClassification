When Green is good here, he is very good, and the mis-steps are minor niggles.[Dec. 2011 p. 132]
	But make no mistake, it's an album that displays growth, maturity and improvement in almost every respect - he's certainly becoming a versatile and engaging artist.
	Precision tooled to keep Green chart and arena-bound for the foreseeable.[Dec. 2011 pg. 94]
	It's a heavy, ambivalent confessional, but Green's precocious personality and distinctive flow manage to keep it fired up.
	While it's sometimes hateful and sometimes hate-filled, "At Your Inconvenience" is rarely boring.
	The result is rather tiring. [Dec 2011, p.95]
	These dated trance beats and chunks of grime tinged R&B aren't going to earn him any new fans, so he's flipped the default switch; if in doubt, get a bit naughty.
	Green's delivery is too Estuary-Eminem, scattershot hip-hop asperity snarled out with a mockney menace that is too secondhand to be effective.
	A depressingly compromised second LP from an artist yet to meet  his early promise.
	His second album is a regression. A year on, the gaudy guitar loops and sleek hip-hop beats sound mundane.
