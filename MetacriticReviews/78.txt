Whenever the delicious sensuality of the music threatens to take over, the anxiety and restless intelligence that drive it return to the surface, creating a quietly riveting tension. Fan Dance could be Sam Phillips' best album yet -- and that's really saying something.
	With Fan Dance, Sam Phillips has made an album that proves modesty is one the rarest and most welcome virtues in pop music today.
	Framed in delicate, candlelit arrangements that beckon like distant ghosts, Phillips addresses matters of faith, love, and spiritual connection in such a way that questions are as important as answers.
	The music is by turns atmospheric, quirky and joyous. [Aug/Sep 2001, p.126]
	Fans will not be disappointed.... This collection of marvelously restless yet intelligent searching clocks in at a mere 33 minutes, yet it's got more quality within it than many CDs twice its length.
	Fan Dance confirms that Phillips has quietly developed into one of the most assured writers and performers in the underpopulated field of adult pop.
	A less produced, totally honest and much more sparse collection than what fans were dancing to with Omnipop.
	Some may find the subtle Fan Dance too unadorned, but its quiet beauty holds real strength.
	Fan Dance is one of those albums that needs to be absorbed to be fully enjoyed, and those who take the time are sure to find its many rewards.
	On first hearing, it's a record to admire rather than love, but its insidious appeal soon gets under your skin. [Sep 2002, p.112]
	An album that's as entrancing as it is modestly proportioned. [June 2002, p.121]
