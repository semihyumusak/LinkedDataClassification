The lack of woe-is-me melancholy on Mindy Smith's fourth release, Stupid Love, is what makes the heartrending album so intriguing.
	The songs generally sound as tuneful and well-crafted as her earlier work, but Stupid Love sounds curiously chicken-hearted when it reaches for its pop gestures, a shame since the songs where she pushes hardest in that direction are the ones that succeed the most.
	Smith's latest, Stupid Love, goes a long way toward correcting those earlier mistakes, and it easily stands as her most accomplished, most substantial record.
	The Long Island native is too unruly to fit into a mainstream country costume. Her pop sweet tooth is in full effect here on the single 'Highs and Lows' and 'What Love Can Do,' which nod to Rumours-era Fleetwood Mac.
	Succinctly stated, Mindy Smithâ€™s voice has a power and a complexity that her songs (or her perspectives) have not yet achieved. This leaves Stupid Love a pleasurable and poignant affair, but not as emotionally gripping as it could be, or wants to be.
	This is a scattered, sometimes awkward effort from a singer who has been, until now, tonally consistent and confident.
