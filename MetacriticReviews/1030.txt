As far as second albums go, it is a brilliantly bold, robust work, showcasing real development and the kind of graceful erudition that places Regan squarely ahead of the curve.
	He remains a formidable wordsmith, and a fast mover by the looks of things. However his career develops, it will be crucial for him to keep a tight hold of the bewitching elements that help make not just his debut, but also his latest, a refreshing listen.
	While not wholly abandoning the folkie acoustica of his Mercury-nominated debut, "The End of History," he's discovered the pleasure of plugging in, turning up the volume and roving in a bluesy, rockabillyish direction. And a pleasure it generally is.
	Regan cross-wires mid-'60s Dylan and Paul Simon with the '70s CBGB pantheon, his songcraft on the verge of cohering his quirkily arresting strengths into true brilliance. [Feb 2010, p. 92]
	If Regan's Mercury Prize-nominated debut in 2006 attracted comparisons with Nick Drake, this belated follow-up ditches the finger-picking folksiness for full-on rock, and sees Regan mutate into a latterday Mike Soctt. {Feb 2010, p.96]
	Not only is he an edgy folk singer, but Regan's second album sees the young Dubliner plug in to a similar ragged, rockabilly vein to Dylan's mid '60s classics. [Feb 2010, p. 111]
	Itâ€™s a fully realised, sprightly rocking album that proves that sometimes musicians are best left alone to do what they do best.
	If leaving Lost Highway was a blow to Regan's confidence you'd never know it from hearing this - he's definitely taken the right turning.
