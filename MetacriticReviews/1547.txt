Diverse and constantly engaging.
	A deep, dark and dirty affair. [June 2002, p.88]
	Kudos for making such a disparate collection hang together as a cohesive, upbeat, infectious whole.
	A slick, expertly crafted crossover plea that can't quite push Oakenfold past every other beat-happy producer out there. [Aug 2002, p.88]
	Yes, it's eclectic and he hasn't just slapped together a ragbag of Ibeefa anfums, but this record essentially suffers from a lack of ambition.
	The album works because Oakenfold has abandoned the stylistic limits of trance yet brought the genre's tuneful oomph to tracks with a little more personality.
	Even the highlights are bogged down by ambitious aims that translate blindness as blandness.
	It's hard to discern quite what Oakenfold himself brings to the party. [July 2002, p.117]
	Unfortunately, Oakenfold isn't much of a pioneer any more, and though it's clear his ear for a solid production hasn't deserted him, Bunkka sees him following the trends instead of pushing them.
	Bunkka has the savvy and brass tacks to challenge even the Jedi master of music/marketing synergy, Moby. [Jul 2002, p.97]
	It was a phenomenal album two years ago, when it was called Movement In Still Life and BT released it. Now, in 2002, it just seems dated.
	Spouts off on multiple tangents and never returns.
	Padded out with too much of the Europap that has blotted Perfecto's scoresheet over the years. [Jul 2002, p.116]
	Bunkka proves he can't write songs to save his slipmats. [#8, p.120]
	The commercial techno sludge of Oakenfold's songs on Bunkka suggests that he should have thought twice about veering from his career path as DJ du jour. [Aug 2002, p.160]
	File under: Bunkum. [21 June 2002, p.84]
