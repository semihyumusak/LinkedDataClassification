The brushed drums and acoustic guitars of 'Anniversary' allow her whispery voice room to breathe. [10 Aug 2007, p. 69]
	Beauty & Crime is, without reservation, the defining creative moment of Suzanne Vega's career thus far.
	It's trim rather than hurried, does not waste a note and, because of that, may be the best of Vega's seven studio albums.
	While the lovely melodies and Vega's hushed vocals make it perfectly good background music, to achieve the full effect you have to listen to those lyrics--she's one of the finest lyricists of recent times.
	Underneath all of those lush, gorgeous strings, [producer] Hogarth then layered the electronic beats, delays, fades, and distortions that lend the album its freshness and vitality.
	Thanks to a keen sense of proportion and concision--and the unmannered integrity of Ms. Vega’s singing style--the album isn’t ponderous.
	Almost every song is a gem, the lyrics thoughtful and melodies memorable.
	Beauty & Crime, an artful array distinguished by classy sonic design and lyrical charm.
	The results are richly satisfying throughout.
	Nothing too dire mars Vega’s compositions, which remain as condensed and detailed as Victorian miniatures.
	The first five cuts on Beauty & Crime are absolutely gorgeous--near and sheer perfection.... The remaining songs, while enjoyable and meeting Ms. Vega’s usually high lyrical standards, don’t gel quite as smoothly.
	Beauty & Crime is an effective meeting point between her folky organic side and more experimental bent, and is populated with her strongest melodies since the dazzling "Nine Objects of Desire." [Summer 2007, p.91]
