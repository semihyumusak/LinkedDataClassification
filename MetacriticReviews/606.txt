A bruisingly great collection of demented 1988-style boom-bap. [May 2004, p.107]
	Ghostface... comes off hungrier than ever to produce thrilling hip-hop. [14 May 2004, p.68]
	Fourteen listens deep, this is still getting better. All but a rap classic. You know, Kanye's good, but really, fuck that. Ghost for president.
	Though his rhyming Wu-Tang compatriots are conspicuously absent, Ghostface's latest does what nearly all latter-day Wu-Tang releases have been trying to do without much success: return to the brilliance of 36 Chambers. [28 Apr 2004]
	Pretty Toney far surpasses 2001's Bulletproof Wallets, finally finding the missing link between street cred and commercial respect.
	"Hip-hop soul" is supposed to be for r&b singers, but Ghostface's latest redefines the term.
	Forget notions of old or new schools: this is an album that blends a kindergarten-level technique with styles that are strictly postgraduate. [Jun 2004, p.116]
	[He] truly shines.
	"Pretty Toney" doesn't match the high standard of Ghostface's first two, "Ironman" and "Supreme Clientele," but it's a strong album nonetheless, packed with dense narratives and weird conceits.
	An album full of voluptuous soul samples fused with brusque perspectives on love, life, and common thuggery.
	The first five tracks are some of the rawest the nine-man conglomerate has ever served.  But this all transpires within the first fifteen minutes of the disc. From there Pretty Toney takes a few ugly turns.
	More than any of his previous albums, Pretty Toney hones Ghost's wild style into accessible confections.
	It's partly a party album like 2001's Bulletproof Wallets, but freer, more inspired, and tempered with pure street tracks that were missing last time round.
	Unfortunately, The Pretty Toney Album falls short in replacing what Raekwon had contributed to Ghost's previous album releases, causing the album to feel essentially incomplete.
