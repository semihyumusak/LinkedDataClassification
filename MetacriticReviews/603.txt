Broadcast revel in a compelling slowness, even at their most cheery, with melodies just beyond sing-along enveloped in soft basslines and fizzing samples. [#46, p.28]
	An album so autonomous and remote it sounds like it's being beamed from a deep-space probe.
	Broadcast manipulate their equipment to give the music the rangy pulse of jazz. It's electronic, but not shot full of skittering beats. The extra charge comes from the girl out front.
	A collection of more shimmering, weightless pop that is nostalgic for yesterday's visions of the future but remains on the cutting edge of contemporary music.
	Imagine the Bronte sisters trying to play Yo La Tengo music on Air's instruments with Joe Meek producing.
	Harkens back to the European pop of the '50s and '60s.
	At first audition, Broadcast is disposable John Barry-inspired pop drenched in overcharged organs, egregious electronic overproduction and languorous vocals that somehow have no residue.
	There's a prevailing sense of definite vision, but not one of the product being excessively labored over. Sure, there's craft at work here, but whereas most albums recorded over long periods of time sound weary and defeated in the final analysis, The Noise Made by People is positively vibrant and alive.
	Broadcast's strange mix of electric keyboards, sampled strings, soundtrack chic, and Trish Keenan's coolly regulated vocals offering hypnotic chill-out music for the new century.
	The debut offering from England's Broadcast cascades over the listener like a lush film score.
	Broadcast are detached and austere, but mesmerised by their discoveries in the radiophonic workshop. Current single Echo's Answer and the unusually upbeat Come On Let's Go are the best places to start, but this is a classic case of an album working as a whole. Hard work, but compelling.
