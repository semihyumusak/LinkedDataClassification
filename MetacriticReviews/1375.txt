Could well be her finest yet. [Oct 2001, p.128]
	Her calm, hushed, clear singing only emphasizes the emotional torment the songs trace. The result is an album on a par with her best work.
	Infinite sadness, hypnotic beauty. [28 Sep 2001, p.74]
	Per usual, the content is clouded in misery--the kind of soft, sad and touching tracks that'll have Dido fans rediscovering this Greenwich Village adult-alternative pioneer
	A polished, classy album whose retrained elegance and melancholy resonance more than compensate for its lack of rhythmic and instrumental restlessness.
	Vega's been good before, especially on her eponymous 1985 debut and its '87 follow-up, Solitude Standing, but never as consistently good as she is here.
	Revealing a songwriter unwilling to compromise even when it hurts, Songs makes her return all the more welcome.
	[Her songs are] articulate and bright, enlivened by pithy metaphors and images that suggest a well-rounded English major with a sensitive side.
	A simple, often stark record reminiscent of her eponymous 1985 debut.
	One of Vega's best. [Oct/Nov 2001, p.114]
