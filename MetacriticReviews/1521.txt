Unfashionable and intensely melodic. [June 2002, p.110]
	An engaging, challenging listen. [Apr 2002, p.77]
	Once over the shock of Mould's familiar tones being vocodered beyond recognition, Modulate offers some of his most effective pop songs. [June 2002, p.120]
	Although the whole thing begins to make more sense after (many) repeat listens, the overall results are at best uneven, and at worst, absolutely baffling.
	Both sublime and ridiculous. [Jun 2002, p.114]
	This is a transitional album: Mould sprinting away from his past. [Apr/May 2002, p.116]
	Modulate finds him bounding around various points on the spectrum to varying degrees of creative success.
	He seems a bit misguided in places, confusing the message and the medium as he enters these uncharted waters.
	Sadly, Modulate comes off as a former punk's clumsy and unsuccessful attempt at diving into a genre that relies less on the organic than it does on the synthetic. [May 2002, p.96]
	A largely frustrating set of Saturday morning cartoon electronics.
	Modulate has its share of dogs; tepid opener "180 Rain" and cheesy "Quasar" could've been left off here with no net loss. When Mould lets the guitars ring through the layers of keyboards and drum machines, as on the romantic lament "Come on Strong," however, minions will find their faith restored.
