Sometimes it seems almost sleight-of-hand that any music could have so much going on and yet be so spacious.
	Rootsy and undeniable, The Intercontinentals is yet another Frisellian work of genius.
	Simultaneously adventurous, beautiful, and full of depth.
	This is a remarkable album; it sets a new water mark for Frisell's sense of adventure and taste, and displays his perception of beauty in a pronounced, uncompromising, yet wholly accessible way.
	The result is laidback and chilled. [Apr 2003, p.104]
	An album of languid grooves and slowly descending melodies. [#16, p.117]
	Every once in a while a drone or pattern emerges, reminding me of what I treasure most in "world music"-- articulated rhythm. Then he gets some tech genie or steel player to throw on another synth substitute and it's back to the miasma.
