Complete and utter filth from start to finish, and that's as high a compliment as we can bestow on an album.
	Say hello to the future of electrofilthsoulhop.
	Yes, this is a funny record, but it's not a comedy record; Har Mar has an acrobatic voice that rivals pretty much any male in R&B today, and he writes some genuinely catchy, sticky melodies that lots of other acts would kill for.
	Har Mar won't dazzle anyone with his pipes or lyrical acumen (well, actually, he already has, but they should all know better), but he's got a deft touch with catchy dance hooks and infectious melodies.
	Like his cultural contemporary Andrew W.K., Har Mar Superstar can't help but inspire the question, "Is this guy for real?" There's a simple answer: Yes and no.

	If these tracks had even the slightest shred of originality, it would be one thing, but Tillmann's on autopilot from the moment we push play.
	Incompetent satire. [Apr 2003, p.106]
