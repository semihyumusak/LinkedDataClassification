Innovative and gorgeous, equally recalling Dionne Warwick-era Bacharach and contemporary ambient pop.
	A strong rebound that finds lang supported by the sleek, techno-lite production of Damian leGassick?
	The production... is appropriately lush and celebratory, brimming over with strings, synthesizers and layered, sensuous vocals. [July 2000, p.111]
	Summer's tunes have the sweetness and light of Burt Bacharach's finest.
	A glorious blend of surf-pop and Brazilian rhythms?
	The songs on "Invincible Summer," nearly all of them written by lang and various partners, aren't up to the standard of those on "Drag".... But the lyrics finally don't matter much because the record holds together as a mood piece.
	The music is often quick-paced fluff with the retro exactness, and the soul, of a Pottery Barn sofa. But for the most part, lang's lighter musical tack encourages her to retire the galloping self-regard that can cancel the attractiveness of her voice.
	If there is a fault to this album, it is that it is too smooth; while the listener is surfing these waves of happiness and cushiony pop, an occasional desire for edges and bones surfaces.
	What is meant to sound languid and trippy instead comes across as overwrought and pretentious?
	11 new songs of singularly cloying contentment; no soaring highs, no debilitating lows, just minor pop platitudes with hollow, echoing centres.
	Instantly forgettable... consistently tepid, devoid of personality, and characteristic of a considerable talent on auto-pilot.
