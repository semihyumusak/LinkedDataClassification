Overall, Josh's sound boasts enough twang to keep it country and enough soulful passion to keep things interesting.
	He sings with an easy, un-self-conscious Southern accent, and his songs, often written with collaborators, address the issues you'd expect: family, courtship and self-doubt, with a faint flicker of vice.
	The music is well-crafted, and Kelley a more than passable singer, with a voice that breaks or gets a bit husky in all the right places. But there isn't anything that makes him stand out from other inhabitants of Music City's sensitive-guy subdivision.
	He also leans a bit too heavily on co-producer Clint Lagerberg, who wrote Rascal Flatts' chart-topping "Here Comes Goodbye" but fails to bring similar hitmaking hooks to Kelley's table, and his vocals sound forced, with a deep baritone twang replacing the breathy croon he used on earlier albums.
