Ten$ion's depiction of modern South Africa is nothing less than thrilling.
	Guaranteed both to amuse and to confuse, Ten$ion is a masterpiece of kitsch: an intently provocative, tongue-in-cheek rave-rap record, by a cryptic performance art group.
	The biggest, brashest cartoon this side of Eminem's early albums.
	A calling-card track like their debut's "Enter the Ninja" is absent, making this album more an exciting celebration for established fans than an easy entry point.
	The devilish duo flips dubstep, EDM, and Dr. Dre's 2001-era G-funk with nary a hitch.
	For the most part, Ten$ion is a letdown in its utter normalcy.
	Still sounds weird and abrasive in the best possible way.
	The problem with much of Ten$ion isn't that it doesn't feel smart-good music has never, and will never have to be "smart"-but that it feels deliberately stupid.
	Neither the downfall nor demystification of the group, the truly awful Ten$ion only further tangles the mess of questions surrounding Die Antwoord.
	Despite more of the foul-mouthed impish fun, Ten$ion doesn't offer much punch or cohesive power.
	On Ten$ions, they replace what made them sometimes intriguing and slightly subversive with tired tropes and lazy lyrics.
	TEN$ION, by contrast [to $0$], hews a little too close to the fake-gangster thing to be nearly as fun.
	The novelty runs dry on Die Antwoord's second album, a marathon of overwrought beats and clunky horn-dog-rebel boasts.
	Hi-Tek's construction of techno beats and rave stabs on the quirky I Fink U Freeky and heavy brostep on opener Never Le Nkemise just add to the nauseating concoction of trash that comprises Ten$ion.
