The album is scattershot to its last breath, but the thrill of watching this hood star threaten to supernova is a real high.
	Overall, the album has a good balance of solo tracks and features.
	It feels like a pleasant yet unremarkable switch back to the past, the sound of Air staring into a half-empty well of ideas, on the verge of becoming their own tribute band.
	Live From The Kitchen is just about the most predictable rap album you could ever listen to.
	As with so many of the tracks on Live from the Kitchen, the material isn't good, and Yo Gotti doesn't strain himself trying to save it.
