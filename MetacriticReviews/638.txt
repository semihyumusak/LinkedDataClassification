Here he redoes his early hits alongside pals like Bruce Springsteen, Billy Corgan, and Spoon.
	The performers on this one likely count it among their career highlights, but those who have kept up with the quality of Davies' output in recent years may well be more interested in what he has yet to say rather than revisiting what he's already said so beautifully.
	The highlight of this collaborative set is "Days/This Time Tomorrow," a medley of Kinks classics.
	A tribute album starring the man of honor himself, who also curated the whole affair, See My Friends is a bit of a curious creature.
	See My Friends sees him plunder his back catalogue, with generally pleasurable results.
	These all-star gatherings are more fun for the artists than the listener.
	It feels like a personal journey through the past on his part, and a genuine tribute from those who've contributed.
	See My Friends proves, if nothing else, that there's simply no force on Earth malevolent enough to destroy a good Ray Davies ditty.
	Davies' voice, weathered but still fine as a Waterloo sunset, is complemented by few here. [Dec 2010, p.113]
	Sadly, See My Friends is mostly embarrassing, pairing Davies with ill-matched partners like Billy Corgan, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, and Metallica, who reduce "You Really Got Me" to third-rate bar-band fodder.
	Square-peg/round-hole pairings of the Kinkster and guests seldom jell as duets (Bruce Springsteen), but covers from Lucinda Williams ("Long Way From Home") and Jackson Browne ("Waterloo Sunset") make for choice B-sides.
	See My Friends will not be a stain on Ray Davies' soul. By the same token, it will be forgotten pretty quickly.
	The occasional highlight isn't enough to make up for the cloth-eared versions of timeless songs found elsewhere on the record, or to cover up for the fact that See My Friends is a mostly soulless, and an entirely pointless album.
