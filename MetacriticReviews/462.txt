At this point, Starr’s limitations as a vocalist and a songwriter are well known. But if you’ve been on the Starr trip thus far, Y Not shouldn’t jostle you off.
	The heart of the 10-song collection comes from his continued exploration of how to hold onto noble ideals in the face of ever-rising cynicism and violence.
	The big guns are firing again on his newest release, Y Not, and to good effect.
	His 16th studio album, Y Not--recorded with a cast of all-stars including Paul McCartney and Joss Stone--is full of straightforward, sweetly melodic tunes, most of them about Starr's abiding optimism.
	There is charm to Starr’s tried and true: exciting it is not but it’s as comforting as an old friend who doesn’t change, he just stays the same.
	Amid the cornball sentiments and bizarre arrangements elsewhere, here against the odds, a touching moment presents itself. [Mar 2010, p.96]
	Ringo makses a good fist of his production debut. [Apr 2010, p.98]
	The Beatlesque affectations of Starr's recent discs have been replaced with determinedly bland '80s production, although there are still enough painfully underwritten peace 'n' love aphorisms to make even a Rip Van Winkle hippie wince.
	Ringo solo album... Come back! It’s not that bad!
	Flush with broad sentiment and a messy spread of good feelings, Y Not finds the funniest Beatle on the outside of the joke.
	It's a faintly embarrassing trifle that only a 69-year old ex-Beatle could get away with. [Apr 2010, p.120]
