While mewithoutYou is still as ambiguous as ever with their music, they've never been as creative and daring as they are on Ten Stories.
	mewithoutYou managed to synthesize its various explorations into a richer sound, using the sort of palette necessary to adequately pummel the album's deep meditations while properly expressing the emotional potency they contain.
	Ten Stories is at ease with its ambiguity and style-shifting.
	Ten Stories should easily please any mewithoutYou fan, but this is by no means pandering....11 musically and lyrically engaging stories. [Jun 2012]
