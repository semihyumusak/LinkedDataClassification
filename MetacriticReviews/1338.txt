De Vermis Mysteriis is a bloody, hard-fought triumph.
	With De Vermis Mysteriis, the beauty of High on Fire is visible therein, as enjoyment may be found on numerous levels.
	It is a ferocious and captivating listen that twists and turns through the deepest darkest depths all the while pushing forward into new sonic territory.
	De Vermis offers nothing but variations on Pike's well-established fixations. But what stunning variations they are.
	They've found a way to be ambitious while also elemental, a difficult trick that Sleep pulled off on Holy Mountain and Dopesmoker, and one that High on Fire have nailed here.
	An utterly furious assault of gritty doom riffs and whisky-addled power, chugging, twisting and thundering with an energy the band have not found in years. [Jun 2012, p.100]
	Once more they've turned sludge, slime and slurry into heavy metal gold.
	Keeping it abrasive and sincerely metal in execution is its strength.
	The whole is so relentlessly nasty and the riffs so good that a multitude of metal sins are forgiven.
	While De Vermis Mysteriis is probably not the group's finest hour (2002's Surrounded by Thieves still bears that distinction), it is nonetheless a very fine hour indeed.
	What we're left is all the brutality of High On Fire's previous work, but with a razor-edged focus. [May 2012, p.79]
	De Vermis Mysteriis gets up in your face, and it never really steps back until it's over.
	The Oakland trio's sixth battering ram rebounds from 2010's scattershot Snakes for the Divine, blowtorching the veneer off previous summit Death Is This Communion in a sh*tstorm of scabrous distortion.
	His [Kurt Ballou's] success here makes De Vermis Mysteriis the closest thing to a standout that the High on Fire catalog can claim, and the band makes good on what Ballou brings to the table.
	It is simple, it is pure, it is predictable, it is Another High on Fire Album.
