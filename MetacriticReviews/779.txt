The Wonder years have not only delivered a genuinely great pop-punk record but a genuinely great record, period. [8 Oct 2011, p.50]
	Overall, it's hard to find much fault with The Wonder Years, and it's remarkable how cohesive it feels given that it's a compilation album.
	It's not simply a retrospective affair, but a calling card illustrating why this beat-maker wears a crown on his album cover.
	The Wonder Years will be remembered with great fondness.
	Loyal fans of underground hip-hop already know he's earned that crown on the cover, and with this purposefully packaged showcase now in place, the uninitiated have no excuse.
	This is a Hip Hop album, complete with the wondrous elements consistent with a broader musical appreciation. And it just might be 9th Wonder's best yet.
	9th's created an album that slowly backs away from the bigger, heavily soulful tracks he's best known for and delivers some more subtle, softer work.
	Don't let Miller's presence detract you from buying an otherwise perfectly adequate album. Let the rest of the stuff that's wrong with it do that.
