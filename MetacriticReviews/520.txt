They're still aggressive, heavy and furious, but this new approach also makes them relevant, incisive and swaggering again. [10 Dec 2011, p.50]
	Their boldest and best album for years. [Jan 2012, p.124]
	Despite all the electronics, there's no mistaking The Path of Totality as a Korn album...and one of their better ones to boot.
	Surprisingly good genre-crossover experiment.
	The Path Of Totality is overall quite an interesting and largely rewarding proposition. Whether it manages to please dubstep or Korn fans however is another matter.
	Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon, particularly in the cuts produced by Skrillex.
	Much as there's no getting away from the fact that this is basically one long remix, it's much better than the car crash we all predicted it would be.
	The combination of chugging half-time beats, machine gun riffing and techno's sonic extremism is way more pleasing than it should be, the weakest point being Jonathan Davis's earnest adolescent vocals, which we assume actual Korn fans will enjoy.
	Sonically, The Path of Totality feels culturally authentic and trendy, while at the same time, pounding enough for mosh pits and dance floors alike.
	They get full marks for effort but, unfortunately, not for the end results.
	This is the same ol' Korn you've loved or hated (or felt indifferently toward) since you first saw that slo-mo bullet in the "Freak on a Leash" video, except with de-tuned guitars swapped for garish, beefy synths.
	How does this sucker sound? Not very good.
	It is samey, ugly and spectacularly stupid at the same time.
	The Path Of Totality is an album that doesn't work because it tries to be something it's not; no, it fails because of not just its terrible premise but its truly dreadful execution.
	To Korn's credit, The Path Of Totality is its most radical reinvention to date. It's also the worst slab of sludge it ever shat.
