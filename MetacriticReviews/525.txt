Could be the best album he's ever made. [Dec 2004, p.146]
	What I Do feels like one of Jackson's most assured and best albums, proof positive that he's the best mainstream country singer of this decade.
	Reaffirms his position as one of the genre's most believable balladeers. [17 Sep 2004, p.78]
	He often starts with a familiar scenario or sentiment, then finds a way to wriggle free of predictability without giving up on the initial idea.
	Even when the emotions don't run especially deep, Jackson always sounds as though he means every word and gives those words his utmost respect. [5 Sep 2004]
	As a whole, the album stands as a benediction to an artist whose integrity and success has prevailed in the face of endless trends and fads that have swept away many lesser talents.
	The enjoyable What I Do is similarly assured and clunker-free, but it also returns to the emotional compression that Drive often detoured.
	A solid disc that lacks some of the emotional punch of 2002's Drive.
