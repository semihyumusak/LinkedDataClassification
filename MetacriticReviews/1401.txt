In bringing to light these stillborn-again pleasures, The Caretaker reveals himself to be nothing less than formidably eponymous.
	Bliss is eerie because it takes the seduction of those forms and turns it slightly askew; there's something unsettling about the musical equivalent of a permanent smile.

	As a whole, An Empty Bliss is a remarkably cohesive listen and one that achieves its goals, but whether or not it, in and of itself, is an entirely creative work is another question entirely.
	Even with today's technology, harvesting emotions as such is perplexing and strenuous. But Kirby does it with a special kind of grace.
