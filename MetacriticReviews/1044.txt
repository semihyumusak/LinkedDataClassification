Life in a Beautiful Light, at its essence, is the sound of an artist looking for her own voice amidst the deafening roar of her influences.
	Despite some bland detours into the middle of the road, there are still enough good moments here to remind of her talent.
	This album just seems too comfortable.
	While lyrical simplicity is welcomed when attached to music that dazzles, here it regularly sounds predictable.
