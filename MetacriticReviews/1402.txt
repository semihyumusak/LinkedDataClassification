A giant leap forward--in instrumental prowess, and in emotional and melodic scope. [8 Oct 2004, p.113]
	Pulling off the tricky balancing act of aiming for mainstream success while keeping one's street cred intact, songs like "Ghost of You" and "Predictable" abandon the band's mall-rat roots in exchange for more mature influences like U2 and Muse.
	The band takes its proven peppy rock sound to new heights.
	For all their well-crafted ambition on Chronicles, "I Just Wanna Live" feels like Good Charlotte's centerpiece, since it's spiked with rock power, but gets its soul from the pop life they lead.
	It's hard to know if Madden's complaints seem so tame because the band's music is less zippy, or whether he's just taking the easiest path to the teen masses. [Nov 2004, p.109]
	The band never quite escapes its proven pop formula or simple tales of angst. [10 Oct 2004]

	Good Charlotte have hooks for days and the fun, gloomy Life and Death sounds like a moody missing link between Fountains of Wayne and Thrice.
	Beyond some rich-and-famous irony, not a single suburban detail soils an hour of good intentions. And you know the music overreaches too.
	Good Charlotte's confessionals are typical teenage moans, and their music second-hand Green Day.
	They falter by attempting to stray from the formula they've mastered. [28 Oct 2004, p.100]
	It's nothing if not ambitious... [but] they simply don't have the depth, or the authority, to pull it off. [Dec 2004, p.143]
	The disc is full of ham-fisted experiments. [11 Oct 2004]
	Half the time, Good Charlotte sound like Blink-182 after the snip, the other half they sound like the Backstreet Boys without the songs. [16 Oct 2004, p.48]
