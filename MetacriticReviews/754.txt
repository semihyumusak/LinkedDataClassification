A hilarious effort loaded with satirical song parodies and rock & roll spoofs.
	Always clever, sometimes hysterical, and sometimes cloying, Lynch is a way hipper Weird Al for the post-millennium MTV generation.
	Hearing twenty-one Lynch-penned songs back to back gets exhausting.
	Goofy two-minute singalongs for the Jackass generation.
	This is a guy that more than understands the music he's goofing on-- he worships it.
	If you think The Rutles' Double Back Alley is better than Penny Lane, then this just-over-35-minute's worth of semi-reverential fun is for you. [Aug 2003, p.95]
	By turns alluring, obnoxious, and laugh-out-loud-funny.
	Lynch... crams Fake Songs with parodies and toss-offs that make Weird Al seem like James Thurber. [9 May 2003, p.76]
	The spoofs are pretty much just lazy, fooling-around-in-the-studio exercises, which also holds true for most of the non-fake songs on Fake Songs.
	Based around some laughably accurate and truly entertaining pastiches of artists including Bjork, Bowie and the Pixies, the rest of the album is pure filler. [Aug 2003, p.100]
	Like many comedy albums, it delivers initial laughs, with few surprises for continual listening.
	Tough to endure even once. [Aug 2003, p.110]
	Please, nothing like this again.
	This shit is boring.
	It's hard to think of any reason to buy this album, and if you do, it's hard to imagine any reason for listening to it more than once (unless you hate your neighbors or your cat).
	Liam Lynch is about as funny as the plague, and even that had its moments in Monty Python. This doesn't have any.
