Electric Version may be a bit less delirious at times, but it's still christened with that same sort of mystical, pop-hook abracadabra that results in happily ingratiating tunes. [9 May 2003, p.76]
	This is fun, fun, fun stuff -- one of the yearÂ’s best albums, no doubt.
	What's the point in complaining that Electric Version doesn't offer enough of one of its countless good things? The only thrill missing here is the enviable joy of hearing New Pornographers for the first time.
	It's every bit as good, if not better, than their first.
	The lyrics might not make much sense, and there's nothing groundbreaking here, but with songs as ridiculously catchy and fun as these, who cares?
	Power pop just doesn't get any more powerful or poppy than this, with all three singers in fine form and the band -- all high-strung keyboards and frenetic drums -- blazing away at the speed of sound.
	Tremendous craft, winning enthusiasm.
	It feels more like a band effort, allowing itself to breathe a little more in places.
	Those expecting the dense, powerful, and insistently upbeat onslaught of Mass Romantic will no doubt react to Electric Version with some degree of initial disappointment. Repeated listens, however, reveal that Electric Version not only displays Carl Newman's brilliant and unique pop sensibility, but allows it enough space to reveal previously obstructed layers of emotional depth.
	Electric Version does little to alter the successful New Pornographers formula. It's a longer, louder and (most importantly) more assured album than its predecessor, but if you liked Mass Romantic, you won't be disappointed. And if you disliked Mass Romantic, you may have a difficult time telling the two albums apart.
	The kind of album that functions as both background BBQ beat and windows-down sing-along. [Jul 2003, p.112]
	It's an album's worth of smart, solid pop music that lingers in the memory.
	New Porn songs gush eagerness and surge like the front car of a roller coaster. [May 2003, p.122]
	Nothing here approaches the pop perfection of Romantic's "Letter From An Occupant," but songs like Newman's "The Laws Have Changed" and Bejar's spirited "Testament to Youth in Verse" nonetheless add weight to one of the year's strongest and unabashed pure-pop releases.
	At their best, the New Pornographers effortlessly dress down emotional defenses and bestow, for at least a moment, simple joy.
	Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility.
	Though not perfect, the New Pornographers are getting closer. [#5, p.87]
	There's nothing profound about Electric Version. But classic pop has seldom sounded so much fun. [Jun 2003, p.98]
	Despite their hookiness, the thirteen uniformly upbeat tracks do sound a little too samey at times.
	The album has textures that make the group's 2000 debut, Mass Romantic, sound medieval by comparison.
	The awe fades quickly as this album progresses. [Jun 2003, p.100]
	The main, fundamental problem with this album is that as good as the melodies are, it really does fall flat in trying to get you to feel anything.
