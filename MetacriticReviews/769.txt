An enjoyably bad-ass record. [Feb 2002, p.102]
	Kid Rock's tear-down-the-walls ideal of a world where rappers can sip whiskey with rednecks is a compelling fiction, and if the cross-pollinated musical results aren't always as exciting as the conversation no doubt would be, you have to at least admire the breadth of his vision.
	The Detroit rapper brags about life after success--money, women, drinkin'--and uses his mediocre rhyming skills on anthemic, fist-pumping Rock staples like "Forever" and "Cocky."
	While he boasts none of the verbal dexterity of Eminem, he takes America's Dumb & Dumber obsession and has mighty fun with it. [Jan 2002, p.102]
	More often than not, Rock lets his flag of self-awareness fly right alongside his freak flag.
	Cocky's surprises remain few and far between.
	What's curious here is how, for all the Kid's ludicrous victory laps, 'Cocky' is so soft in the middle.
	Some great moments, but too much filler and too few anthems. [Mar 2002, p.99]
	Cocky plays it safe, tinkering slightly with Devil's formula but generally delivering virtual carbon copies of its monster hits.
	Lyrically, he's got one thing to say: Kid Rock is back, Kid Rock has lots of money, Kid Rock has the dames licked down, Kid Rock is hard. Which is all good when done properly, with wit, but Kid Rock is not clever, and he's not funny.
