Ultimately, by pushing the dance beats and the slabs of synth to the foreground, the Sounds  have increased their pop appeal and delivered an album that pleases your ears while also demanding that you leave your blood on the dancefloor.
	The record as a substantial body of work comes complete with up-tempo numbers that are danceable but without an enticing hook, a few straightforward pop/rock tunes with tremendous choruses, and an album ending ballad that renders the album slightly indifferent, inconsistent and lacking an underlying direction and purpose.
	Something To Die For has the Swedish dance/pop outfit awkwardly dipping a toe into the pool of trance music.
	Their fourth album amps up the synths-and-beats side of their new wave Scandi-rock aesthetic, with broadly positive results. [Jul 2011, p.94]
	The problem with Something To Die For is that it's an album built to succeed on the strength of its hooks and not its songwriting.
	The Sounds' latest release is another attempt to gain entry into the world of success that eluded them when their contemporaries took off into permanent stardom.
	The album's largely a series of almost good songs and will likely get a fair amount of play both on college radio and in clubs.
	Something sounds like they need some time off. [May 2011, p.86]
