A rough, back-to-basics rap album.
	A dull slog with a dearth of hooks and a surfeit of gangsta cliches. [21 Nov 2003, p.87]
	From the amateurish cover art to a succession of clumsy diss tracks aimed at Fiddy, Blood in My Eye merely makes the Tupac disciple look desperate and directionless.
	Consists almost entirely of antagonistic digs at 50, Eminem and Dr Dre, none of which are terribly sharp. [Jan 2004, p.105]
	As refreshing as it is to hear Ja do something besides the singing approximation he's been practicing the past few years, the boasts here feel utterly tired.
	Desperately slim pickings... betray this release's roots as a mere EP. [Jan 2004, p.116]
	There are only two quality songs, a lot of redundant trash-talking, and an overall sense of ridiculousness that pervades.
	Committed Ja Rule fans looking for those signature hip-pop collaborations he's taken to the bank before wonÂ’t find them here.
