Let your guard down and jam some Bizkit.
	Gold Cobra reminds us of how much fun a tight, no-holds-barred rap-metal record can be in the right hands.
	So is it any good? Does it matter? Limp Bizkit are bigger than ever before so getcha groove on, stop taking things seriously.
	The overall impression is that the Bizkit remain as annoying, entertaining and incorrigibly obnoxious as they ever were. [25 Jun 2011, p.50]
	Sure, as sheer sound, it's executed well -- more assured, musical, and, well, professional than any of their other albums, their age lending them a dexterity absent in their hits -- but the deliberate retro-rage begs the question: who exactly is this music for?
	With the exception of the always inventive playing of guitarist Wes Borland, here Limp Bizkit sound like a band whose time has passed. Given that this is a group that boorishly exemplified the empty materialism and crass self-centredness that lurked at nu-metal's core, this is surely no bad thing.
	Gold Cobra props itself up as the best thing we've seen from our most hated band since even 1997, and the two albums following that had enough singles to fill a greatest hits compilation one record ahead of schedule.
	The album plays to the band's strengths, but there's simply nothing here as catchy as "My Way" or as infectiously fun as "Break Stuff."
	Oft-delayed, petulant, and hook-devoid "comeback." [1 Jul 2011, p.74]
	Time hasn't been kind to the once-popular amalgam of metal and hip-hop known as n√º-metal, and it's been absolutely brutal to former scene king Limp Bizkit
	It's difficult to believe Limp Bizkit could return after all this time somehow even more hateful than before.
