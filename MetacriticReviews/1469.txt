Wonderful Rainbow is a brilliant record and has upped the ante tremendously for Lightning Bolt. They managed to take every single aspect that made Ride the Skies such a great record and intensify it severely, all the while showcasing incredibly tight and complex musicianship Â– knowing when to hold in the reins and when to set them on fire.
	The net result is an amazing pileup of discount psychedelia and stoner rock grind, with ample doses of ecstatic amplifier brutality thrown in to explode any ham-fisted accusations of classic rock necrophilia.
	Wonderful Rainbow delivers what Ride the Skies most lacked: Musical diversity.
	Perhaps the album's most remarkable feat is its utter lack of density: One never gets the sense that anything excessive or unnecessary was utilized in constructing its sonic brickworks.
	Too mischievous for Led Zeppelin's Valhalla and too self-aware for Bal-Sagoth's Magic Kingdom, Wonderful Rainbow conjures retarded unicorns, copulating robots, and head-banging ogres in one technicolor beat.
	For an album that changes pace only for intensely noisy noodling, Wonderful Rainbow shows remarkable range.
	If the White Stripes gave up blues-rock for steroids, acid and death metal, they might sound something like this. [Apr 2003, p.124]
	Stellar noise pollution. [May 2003, p.99]
	The music is purposeful and powerful. [Jul 2003, p.114]
	If Lightning Bolt works best live, Wonderful Rainbow loses nothing of the duo's spontaneous wallop. [#230, p.56]
	At its best, though, this album is like having a beautiful girl hit you repeatedly over the head with a baseball bat.
	Music of reassuring terror.
	Sounds like classic overcompensation, a racket on wheels trying to live up to its hype by merely playing over it. [#59, p.98]
