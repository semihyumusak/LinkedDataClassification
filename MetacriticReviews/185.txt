Not afraid to be funny because they're having so much fun, Arve-Ahlund-Ahlund are one more electrobeat-wieldingâ€‹  Swedish cartel bent on proving that rock and roll proceeds from enlightened capitalism like we had in America before our plutocrats started expanding the national income gap up past Colombia's.
	It isn't life music, unless you live in a camp permutation of Gold's Gym. The Air-like, Gary Numan-lite instrumentals popping up between the songs with hit potential are way lighter than air. I don't mind 'em, but also don't love 'em.
	Very much like its predecessor, Devil's Music  derives most of its noteworthiness and novelty (and arguably, for better or worse, much of its musical interest) from an impressive, sometimes head-scratching roster of guest vocalists drawn from pop, rock, rap, and reggae.
	The few moments where star power wanes, Teddybears suggest they don't have much to offer on their own.
	Devil's Music lives and dies on the strength of the collaborators (lightweights like Laza Morgan lack the personality to elevate the material), as all the instrumental tracks just sound like long intros to better songs.
	As with any Teddy Bears release, this is all meant to be a sort of pastiche; lots of genre jumping, lots of smooth transitions, lots of hooky goodness mixed with a plethora of guest stars and vocalists.
	Teddybears' second U.S. release seems designed to be a coming-out party, but it's just slick hodgepodge.
	You'd figure we'd at least get a one-off novelty track, but the flat, repetitive melodies and gimmicky rhymes even fail to do that.
