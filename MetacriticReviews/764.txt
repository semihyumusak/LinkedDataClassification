Simply put, either you’ll love this album or not “get” it. It’s too good an album for you to not like if you understand it.
	There's a confidence and a swagger that wasn't there before, Green uncapping the band who can convert his quirky sketches into clever, swinging masterpieces.
	[A] queasy mix of super-sharp realism, clammy surrealism and elegant melody. [Feb 2005, p.98]
	Consistent--and consistently funny. [Apr 2005, p.124]
	His sparse, sweet acoustic songs charm more than they shock, and make you think rather than irritate.
	He's gone for a sound that's somewhere between '50s and '60s rock and musical theatre, halfway between Buddy Holly and Broadway.
	Green's self-consciously dweeby vocals hang his off-kilter lyrics like a doomed curveball.
	It is one thing to not take yourself to seriously but it is quite another to go to the other extreme. For all his knowing winks, Green walks the fine line between decadency and distaste.
	'Gemstones' sees Adam go much deeper into cabaret territory. [22 Jan 2005, p.51]
	Kitschy lyrics spin out of control here.
	His quirks often overwhelm him, and his shock tactics are more infantile than transgressive. [Feb 2005, p.76]
	Over the course of Gemstone's 15 tracks, Green's heavily enunciated, lumbering delivery become more irritating than a busload of thespians on their way to an audition. Thankfully, Green's elementary-school melodies, which call to mind Jonathan Richman at his silliest, ultimately save this album from the topical hell to which it aspires.
	Green's cutesy Bacharach-ish chamber pop loses all novelty after a few spins. [Apr 2005, p.118]
	Gemstones is shit. It's awful. It really, really is.
	His tunes and/or jokes plop out like forced turds. [Mar 2005, p.92]
	His indie-circuit friends will be amused, but no one else will. [4 Mar 2005, p.73]
	Now, potty humor can be funny, but when it's 15 tracks of potty humor set to Raffi polkas, it's just annoying. [#9]
	As worthless as it's possible for music to be. [Feb 2005, p.100]
