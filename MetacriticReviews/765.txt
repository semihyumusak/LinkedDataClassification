Dovetailing with her choice of sound and arrangements that straddle convention and invention, Lopez mines new emotional depths. [31 Mar 2007]
	A sincere album, organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics.
	Como Ama does represent a victory for Lopez by offering fairly persuasive proof that, contrary to rumor, she can sing, and without a regiment of background choralists. All that bulking up she's been doing at the vocal gym isn't enough, though, to turn flaccid torch songs into muscle.
	The problem is that Lopez easily ages herself by a decade or two. In other words, Mama Lopez is probably going to love this album.
	What we get is listless by the numbers "latin rock", dull, sleepy ballads, and overblown Diva numbers I wouldn't wish on Whitney Houston.
	The music... is tacky and overproduced.... The songwriting here far outstrips Lopez's previous albums, though. [May 2007, p.116]
	Sloppy, emotion-free, chicken-in-a-basket ballads. [May 2007, p.125]
