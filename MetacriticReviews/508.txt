Soul Daddy offers the real spirit of the Daddies, a blend of styles that rocks as much as it swings, taking side trips into soul reggae and smoky lounge blues along the way. The combination makes for a much more potent recording.
	This disc is that rare combination of substance (both musically and lyrically) and fun. For those who thought the Cherry Poppin' Daddies were a one-hit, one-dimensional wonder, Soul Caddy will be a pleasant surprise.
	Cherry Poppin' Daddies pull off decent songs even when they aren't the most convincing of exercises in genre - and better than decent when they let the horns loose. Soul Caddy just can't live up to the swingin' good times of its predecessor.
	The musical redefinitions taken on by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies seemed to be creatively suiting and for the listeners who take time to believe in it Soul Caddy will be impressively surprising.
	Frontman Steve Perry is a far better writer than he is a singer. [10/13/2000, p.83]
	With Soul Caddy's stunted riffs, lethargic attack and thin, shiny sound, it's hard to believe that they're one of the most amazing live bands in the country, because exactly none of that energy translates here. Even on theoretical ass-kickers like "Irish Whiskey," the vibe is so washed-out (just like when they do "soul" or "funk" or "glam" or "grunge"), it's a bit depressing and Weird Al-like.
