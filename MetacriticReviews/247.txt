	Multi-instrumentalist/producer Junior masters JS's many loves without having to scale them down, and expands Don't Stop's compact party into a show of force.
	Their heavenly mix of mix of giddy silliness, pop smarts and pop culture overload makes Hey Hey My My Yo Yo a fun-filled, joyride from beginning to end.

	Skeptics be damned that's just what Hey Hey My My Yo Yo is, an improvement and distillation of the duo's sound.

	Hey Hey is an impressively cohesive collection of pop songs.
	Sometimes you really just don’t feel like dancing--and that’s something the poppy Danish duo Junior Senior doesn’t understand.
