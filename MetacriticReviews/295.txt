Kittie's most fully-realised and, for non-metalheads, approachable album yet.
	Has more melody and memorable riffs than the band's previous two albums.
	While siblings Morgan and Mercedes Lander's songwriting has improved since 2001's Oracle, there's still an air of mediocrity to later tracks like "Loveless" and "Burning Bridges" that shows an adherence to formulaic modern metal clich√©s, and a lack of confidence on some of the vocal takes that makes some of the songs sound like demos.
	Makes like the spawn of Hole and Hatebreed. [Sep 2004, p.120]
	They still have plenty of growl left in them. [Aug 2004, p.133]
	Kittie are rubbish, with a permanent lyrical setting of "Feel A Bit Miserable, Parents Don't Understand Me" and no original ideas whatsoever. [21 Aug 2004, p.49]
	Tenaciously mindless and effortlessly grim.
