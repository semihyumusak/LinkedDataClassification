Unlike liars, fakers, and bullshit artists, he backs up his name and claim with anecdotal gems aplenty.
	It's dark but inspirational, catchy but never kitschy. Most of all though, it's honest.
	Evidence won't have the copies flying off the shelf or cause internet hysteria anytime soon, but he can deliver a thoughtful and interesting album in Cats & Dogs.
	Such a well-built slab of indie rap that a four-year wait seems well worth it.
	The fans who ride for Ev won't be disappointed by Cats & Dogs. He continues to show that love for hip-hop on tracks.
	Despite running a bit long, this is clearly one of the year's better releases.
	Cats & Dogs is a moody, well-produced album that, at times, is brimming with meaning-something not entirely common these days.
	Essentially, Evidence harkens back to 00s rap nostalgia without resorting to preachy tirades or regressive concepts, a respite during a time of sing-rap and hyper-aggressive flows.
	Though it runs a little long, Cats & Dogs is a banging, consistent platter that ought to satisfy backpackers and hard-rocks alike.
	There's no bullshit and no nonsense here, but listening to this album,, you might end up wishing that there was. [Dec 2011, p.68]
