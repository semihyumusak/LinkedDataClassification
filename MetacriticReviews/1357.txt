In terms of consistency, craftsmanship and musical experimentation, Goddess in the Doorway surpasses all his solo work and any Rolling Stones album since Some Girls.
	An energetic, intelligent and fairly modern rock album - not exactly cutting-edge, but not entirely anachronistic either.
	His most diverse and musically adventurous solo set to date.
	Goddess is the only forward-looking project by a Rolling Stone since the band flirted with disco on "Miss You."
	A mixed bag, with its fair share of unsatisfactory pop throwaway moments but also a healthy dose of midtempo ballads and stratospheric numbers.
	Goddess In The Doorway is the work of a man who is generally interested and occasionally inspired. [#184, p.135]
	Distinguished, eclectic, and difficult to love.... Mostly the songs beg for a rawer treatment, instead of the polite album-rock for which Jagger generally settles.
	The shock is that Goddess In The Doorway is really rather good. [Dec 2001, p.114]
	Some of it is awful. Some, notably 'Hide Away' and 'Lucky Day' are as good as anything on prime-time Stones album 'Black And Blue', which is saying something.
	Precision-tooled modern rock that aims for radio, not revelation.
	Even the presence of A-list guests can't redeem such jaded, formulaic songs. [#4, p.118]
	All the star power in the world can't save sub-par material.
	The album takes on an airbrushed blandness that drowns out both the odd outbreak of compositional quality and the promise of adventure offered by the guests. [Dec 2001, p.104]
