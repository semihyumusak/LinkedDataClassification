Success has always been Jones' revenge, and while his ringleader ways allow this autobiographical album to sometimes go wildly off concept, it's clearly his most inspired set of songs to date.
	Jim Jones may be rolling out his fourth studio album (and first major-label release) with off-Broadway plays, documentaries and a movie, but don't get it twisted—the Harlem-born rapper hasn't lost his grime.
	So there you have it, a finely produced, polished, and performed album from one of the game's most hated emcees.
	Those looking for timeless music on Pray IV Reign may find their prayers unanswered. But if you’re one of Jones’ longtime disciples, Capo’s got you covered.
	He rhymes more like a ghetto businessman than a natural talent, sprinkling gruff rhymes with silly lines. But his open-armed commercialism mostly works.
	While Jones' confidence as an MC has grown, his talent still lies more with songs of the streets than with songs of the sheets.
	These songs are still full of crude misogyny and tired concepts. Give Jones points for honing his craft, but he's got a long way to go.
	His work is still glaringly standard, all puffed-up machismo and stock sexual banter.
	With the exception of the exuberant 'Pop Champagne,' which was a Ron Brownz single before Jones hopped on it, Reign is a washout.
	Nothing sticks. The only times you’ll be tempted to rewind is when Jones says something stupid, which is often.
	In attempting to make a record that avoids the pop fluff he’s become famous for, Jones almost completely rids Pray IV Reign of the redeemable moments from past releases.
