His previous album's excellence made it seem like Daedelus was working at his peak but amazingly he not only equals that album but surpasses it, creating his most satisfying album since his debut.
	The disc is a dense, cerebral, sweated-over work of art.
	Daedelus weaves his sounds into an intricate sonic tapestry that pleases the ears while stimulating the brain. [Jun 2006, p.110]
	Daedelus does with electronic and Latin music here what he and others have already done with experimental hip-hop: boiling genre to an essence and re-imagining it with novel or illuminating instrumentation.
	The entire album comes across as a pleasingly intimate expression, without once seeming cloying or precocious.
	As something along the lines of throwing an old Pink Panther soundtrack in a blender with a copy of Reason 3, every track on Denies The Day is a scene from a different film you can't quite remember seeing.
	Despite the extremely strong sonic points, most of the album falls short in the songwriting department.
	Never less than inventive. [Jul 2006, p.110]
	The main problem haunting Denies The Day's Demise is the same one that holds back several past releases from Daedelus. While the release is cohesive and fairly entertaining, it could have used a bit more editing in terms of overall running length.
	A tough collection to make friends with, Denies The Days Demise can infuriate and delight in equal measure, often on the same track.
	The breakbeat-based tracks offer obvious comparisons with like-minds such as Prefuse 73. [Jun 2006, p.113]
	If you have the time to dedicate to these genre-bending excursions, the effort can be worth it more often than not.
