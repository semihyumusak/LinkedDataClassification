As edgy as singer-songwriter pop gets. [Oct 2005, p.158]
	Between his willingness to experiment and a bountiful arsenal at his disposal, a spectacular range of dreamlike moods and sounds are created across Infiniheart's sixty-five minutes.
	Infiniheart is too bright, too beautiful, and almost too good to be believed.
	An excellent new-school Neil Young for the Garden State generation. [26 Aug 2005, p.61]
	Contains some of this year's most original and moving songwriting, and displays a breathtaking virtuosity and inventiveness on the part of its creator.
	VanGaalen stuffs these frequently breathtaking songs with death and paranoid visions of dystopias and bad dreams. [Oct/Nov 2005, p.125]
	These are really, really beautiful songs. [#11, p.116]
	At an hour long, Infiniheart occasionally feels infinite, but moments of perfection make VanGaalen's meanderings seem a necessary part of the whole appealing coincidence. [#69, p.110]
	Rife with contrast and irony, Infiniheart plays like a series of short stories or films, somehow interwoven to a common conclusion.
	That's ultimately the sticking point with Infiniheart: VanGaalen's songs tend toward folly, yet it's impossible to discount his commitment to the material.
	Melding big, weary Fleetwood Mac-esque emotion to stretched-out arrangements, both electronic and folk, the Canadian singer/songwriter's power lies in his dedication to his own individuality.
	[An] impressive lo-fi debut. [27 Aug 2005, p.74]
	With 16 thoroughly-developed tracks, clocking in at a little under an hour, Infiniheart is a tedious listen. Though its moments of faltering are few, it's a lot to digest.
	The only consistent thing about Infiniheart is its inconsistency. [Sep 2005, p.116]
	Although annoyingly inconsistent, Infiniheart contains enough interesting tunes with odd arrangements and instrumentation to convince us that Chad Van Gaalen is a talented songwriter and multi-instrumentalist and is capable of producing engaging, lo-fi, ambient pop.
