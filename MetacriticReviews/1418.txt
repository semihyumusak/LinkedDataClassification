Powter firmly establishes himself as a singer/songwriter who sits somewhere between James Blunt and early recordings by Elton John—albeit one who also knows the power of blue-eyed soul. [15 Apr 2006]
	A self-titled debut album steeped in beautiful but bland lovelorn ballads that tip a wool cap to vintage Elton John.
	Unfortunately, Powter doesn’t always take advantage of his talent, and half the album ends up being solidly catchy, but ultimately unremarkable and predictable piano songs.
	As a writer, Powter aims at updating [Elton] John's piano-based format with hip-hop-derived beats, but he lacks the role model's emotional depth. [9 Apr 2006]
	Lacking the star personality of a Robbie Williams or the wit of a Ben Folds, Powter doesn't rise above his instantly familiar keyboard riffs, yet neither does he drown in them.
	A series of expertly produced, expertly recorded adult pop tunes.
	As the album lurches along, you keep hoping for the real Daniel Powter to stand up, but he never quite does. [14 Apr 2006, p.83]
	Like [David Gray and Damien Rice], Powter writes faceless tunes landmined with unsubtle hooks that can devour your brain in less time than it takes for an expert barista to whip up a cappuccino. [Jun 2006, p.143]
	The album's consistency is its downfall; Mr. Powter's chosen sound may stand out on a radio playlist, but over 10 songs it yields diminishing returns. [10 Apr 2006]
	A reminder that "adult" pop can be every bit as vapid and formulaic as its teenage counterparts.
	After a while, it grates badly on the nerves.
