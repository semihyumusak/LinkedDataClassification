The mix is somehow both spacious and full, with each instrument clearly audible at all times, yet making up one part of a majestic whole. This is a great psychedelic hard rock album, only occasionally returning to the sludgy metal of Kylesa's early releases.
	Spiral Shadow might just be the album of the year so far. All hail the kings (and queen) of nouveau-prog.
	Whether bellowed by Philip Cope or sung with witchy intensity by Laura Pleasants, just about every song has a chorus that immediately stamps itself on your brain. In that sense, Spiral Shadow is damn near a pop album.
	In a career full of successful fusions of metal, psych, crusty punk and indie rock, Spiral Shadow is another triumph.
	These perennial up-and-comers are now operating at an elite level. Welcome to the upper tier of American metal, kids.
	Kylesa nods toward their feral past as choruses make muscular concessions to hardcore floor-punches. But other tracks are their artiest and dreamiest yet. [Nov/Dec 2010, p.96]
	This is still towering, hazy, stoner metal--it's just shaped with more craft than once before and is therefore far more interesting. [16 Oct 2010, p.50]
	Spiral Shadow assimilates both paradigms as if Jane's Addiction and Kyuss shared leathers.
	The 78-minute Spiral Shadow supersizes everything, from song lengths to layers of deep-focus space-rock effects, but the sprawling songs are still built around riffs as sweaty as a south Georgia summer.
