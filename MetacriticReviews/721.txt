Apocalyptic Love, the album, is at its best when Slash is operating within the team. [9 Jun 2012, p.52]
	Carolina's use of a talk box a la Frampton stuck in this listener's craw, but elsewhere the urgency and uncensored filth of Slash's playing is a joy. [Jul 2012, p.82]
	This one is cohesive and feels like a band affair, feels like an album, feels like it has the chemistry Velvet Revolver frustratingly didn't quite have but a certain other band had once upon a time when Slash was in that crew.
	Apocalyptic Love is at heart a collection of lean, high-octane rock-and-roll tunes built to be blasted out of open-top sports cars or, more suitably, open-air stadiums.
	A solid if not spectacular release from the king of wail.
	Pretty good but never outstanding.
	In reality, [the album] is another sampling of ridiculous guitar riffs, and for Slash, it's a way to keep playing at a level he can dominate. Is it a new chapter in his career? No. It's just a continuation of previous chapters. But maybe that's OK.
	Apocalyptic Love never tries too hard, so it winds up satisfying on its own limited scale.
	Slash and Kennedy rely on formula rather than chemistry and yield some thin songs tucked into the record's second half.
	There's potential here but it's sadly unrealized.
	Best avoided if you're not a Guns N' Roses completist.
	Each of the album's thirteen tracks passes by without any fuss or fight; every song blending into one long blob of grey matter that leaves such little impression in spite of repeated listens.
	A load of rubbish. [Jul 2012, p.110]
