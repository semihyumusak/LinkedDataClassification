What makes this charged debut such a powerful statement is its impeccable flow. From the moment Devil In Me swaggers in like a Molotov cocktail, you know this is going to rock - hard.
	One of the best British rock albums of the year so far.
	Sure, none of these ideas--musically or lyrically--are anywhere close to original, but they do the job they're trying to do. [#9]
	The likes of "22 Days" and "Devil In Me" exist in a world where only John Lee Hooker and The Stooges have ever made records.
	The 22-20s are simply more of the same--the same clichés, the same melody-free blasts of noise, the same old garage rock that sounds positively primitive.
	The 22-20s evade most of the typical British rock potholes (i.e. histrionics, pretentiousness, unapologetic 60s-aping, among others), and can actually be taken at face value.
	Overall, the album is more competent than distinctive; maybe next time, the 22-20s will show more depth and personality.
	With the extraordinary you get the perfunctory.
	The up-tempo songs don’t show much variation or excitement, but the real fire comes when the band slows it way down or steps out of the garage.
	There's never a sense that the singer convinces himself he's got anything beyond the rote punk/blues motions to draw from. [#67, p.112]
	What's not much in evidence is distinctive or memorable material. [Apr/May 2005, p.141]
	The album, while competent, is thoroughly flawed.
	Evokes a sense that this has all been done before, and better.
