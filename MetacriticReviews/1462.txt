It may be one of the least "punk" albums a pop-punk band will make this year--but it's probably one of the best, too. [Feb 2006, p.113]
	What's surprising, given their rep as just another cookie-cutter teen-emo band, is how well they fare when enlisting unlikely guests for two numbers that abandon their area of expertise altogether. [27 Jan 2006, p.81]
	A strong effort that trades sunny-sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family, "Lights" conveys that maturity without seeming strained. [28 Jan 2006]
	The band shows willingness to break form. [22 Jan 2006]
	Lights and Sounds' good songs are very good, and the album ends up being the band's most accomplished work yet.
	Perhaps the most significant proof of Yellowcard's maturity is their restraint: Violinist Sean Mackin's chops are showcased with much greater subtlety on Lights and Sounds.
	The band goes a different way now, and it's not necessarily a better one.
	It's too tepid to be offensive. [Feb 2006, p.87]
	A band that traffics in momentum can't afford to take their foot off the gas as often as Yellowcard does. [Mar 2006, p.112]
	So while Yellowcard's hearts may be in the right place, it's clear they're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus.
	Contains far too many bland ballads. [Feb 2006, p.105]
	Unfortunately, the sorta-good parts just donâ€™t make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album.
	A substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure.
