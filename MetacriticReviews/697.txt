Overall, ADD demonstrates why Lewis blazed his way into AI's final round: He's out there, sure, but he's willing to reel it in enough to keep it real for the masses.
	"American Idol" season six runner-up Blake Lewis' debut, "ADD: Audio Day Dream," is indeed a little all over the map, but, surprisingly, it works.
	His singing on "Audio Day Dream" is fine; it gets the job done. Yet what arrests your ear are Lewis' ideas.
	A little something for everyone, in other words, though it probably won’t hold anyone’s focus all the way through.
	ADD is certainly one of the more interesting AmIdol-related records, but so much commotion without construction is ultimately as forgettable as Jordin's pageant-winner trifle, and perhaps a little more tiring to get through, too.
	On his debut, Lewis is engaging and diverse, but he also fails to excite or provoke.
	If Lewis could just find a way to integrate all his early-MTV influences (A Flock of Fat Boys?), well...that album wouldn't be great either--though it'd be less forgettable than this exercise in pop adequacy.
