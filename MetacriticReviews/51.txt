Diplo's original production work is the real joy of this compilation though, and probably the crowning gem is 'Solta O Frango,' from the sublime Bonde Do Role album.
	You can quibble with the track list: Some arty blip-and-glitch drags things down a bit, and there's not much favela funk. But Work emphasizes Diplo's huge ears and fondness for warm, open-armed parties.
	the title of this collection gets it a little too right: It's decent, but seldom more.
	Decent Work for Decent Pay, a slipshod m√©lange of long-overdue remixes, is not what we're looking for. Unless you've been living in Kyrgyzstan without an Internet connection for the past few years, you likely wore out most of the tracks on Decent Work for Decent Pay long ago.
	His hard-hitting electro is basic, but brutally effective dancefloor fare. [Feb 2009, p.119]
	His own production work has been inconsistent. [Feb 2009, p.78]
	Like most remix comps, Decent Work is ultimately a grab-bag.
	Decent Work for Decent Pay is choppy and uneven, as many compilation albums are inevitably going to be.
	Disappointingly, this is a shaky collection for such a groundbreaking producer, though unlikely to impact his designs on commercial ascendancy.
	It has plenty of bracingly dynamic moments--a batucada-enhanced reworking of Samim's Heater, the lurching power of Kano's Reload It, the old-skool exuberance of Spank Rock's Put That Pussy On Me--but moments are all they remain.
