Throws out the genre manual and leaves every cell, body and soul, buzzing. [Dec 2005, p.100]
	Steeped in tradition... but also flirts with pop immediacy. [19 Aug 2005, p.144]
	Why Should the Fire Die? is a brave album that warrants more than a passing glance from country and bluegrass purists, and the full support of the indie rock/folk/pop community.
	While their lyrics do tell compelling stories, Nickel Creek's selling point remains their technical gifts and, again, Why Should The Fire Die? showcases a phenomenal learning curve.
	With any luck (and some marketing muscle), this excellent album will find the Dashboard Confessional fans it deserves.
	Unstoppable.
	Why Should the Fire Die? may see Nickel Creek turn further away than ever from CMTâ€™s trappings, but it also shows the band reaching to eclipse its more generic pop-rock reference points as well.
	Why Should the Fire Die? is certainly the trio's boldest and most creative album, albeit one that might not appeal to their earliest fans.
	What will grab you first about the band this time out is their singing. The trio has always sung in gorgeously arrayed harmonies, but Why Should the Fire Die? utilizes sung harmony in striking ways.
	Like most schmoograssers they're committed to virtuosity for its own sake, and like most young musos they've been too focused on technique to learn much about how music interacts with life.
