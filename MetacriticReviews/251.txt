Big Talk is a record to be roared while stood atop the bar, and then deny all knowledge of the next day.
	Big Talk may not have rock star sparkle, but it walks the walk when it comes to solidly entertaining songs.
	Though Big Talk doesn't deviate from the trusted rock-pop path with a few bluesy stepping stones, it's a satisfying listen in which this drummer-turned-front man holds his own incredibly well.
	Vannucci, stepping out from behind the drum kit, may not exactly be Dave Grohl, but his rock 'n' roll yelp is fitting with the music and a solid reminder that we don't need glitzy synths to craft solid, raucous songs. [Aug 2011, p.112]
	Vannucci as a vocalist and lyricist lacks the star power to keep up his larger-than-life showboating over the course of 40-plus minutes.
	Big Talk are less grandoise and more low-key than his dayjob, thought, and these 12 tracks do sag in the middle when this eponymous debut takes a detour into pub rock with No Whiskey and Girl At Sunrise. [Sept. 2011, p. 103]
	It's much more fun than the Brandon Flowers album. Which, admittedly, isn't very big talk at all.
	Halfway in, Vannucci finds his feet with the bluesy No Whiskey, before an impeccable run of spry, sun-kissed alt-country numbers announce him as Las Vegas's answer to Tom Petty.
	What we have is an attempt to boil down old cliches into something fresh, but instead reducing them to the lowest thing rock music: a boring album.
	Drum-heavy powerpop is more comfortable in bleached denim and white trainers, about three decades too late for assured heavy rotation on MTV.
	More than anything, Big Talk reflects the Vegas background of its middling maestro.
	Basically Big Talk is how The Killers might sound if, rather than combining Bruce Springsteen and the Pet Shop Boys, they settle for blending Kings of Leon with ELO. [Sep 2011, p.79]
	Vannucci's listless voice does the songs few favours, either: he's nobody's idea of a commanding presence at the microphone.
