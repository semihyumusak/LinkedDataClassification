While it won't be the best or most important album in the entire catalogue, "Redman Presents... Reggie" fits perfectly into his body of work as a whole and will be worthy of multiple replays after the purchase date.
	Uptight types who want him to save hip-hop will hate on this one, but this ain't nuthin' but a party y'all, and a fun one at that.
	Redman Presents...Reggie isn't near Mr. Noble's best work, but fans would be remised to turn their nose to the project. When he is in his element, he spits harder, and flows better than any of his peers.
	Yet for all the patchy unevenness that comes out in places, the album is also a consistently likable effort.
	Reggie introduces a kinder, gentler Redman, and while the lack of skits is refreshing, it'd be kind of nice to have the old one back.
	I have no interest in warning anyone about this album's positive qualities, because they are so type-neutral. So are the negatives. Reggie is one of those veteran albums that could just as well not exist and no one would bat an eye.
