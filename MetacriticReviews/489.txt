	On Dignity she makes some serious headway into turning into a mature recording artist, which makes this an effective, strangely endearing album.
	Her jump dancewards is curious commercially, but thoroughly worthwhile artistically.
	Duff edges ever closer to adult sensibilities; her goofball Lizzie McGuire days seem far behind.
