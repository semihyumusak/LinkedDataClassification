Most of Mr. Brown suggests this crooner should stick to supporting roles. [6 Oct 2006, p.68]
	Despite the style oozing throughout "Mr. Brown," the album's main -- and consistent -- shortcoming is that there seems to be something missing, lyrically and musically.
	Even though his arrangements and slum-beautiful tracks are sublime, his vocal abilities leave much to be desired.
	Many of Sleepy's songs sound oddly unfinished, relying too heavily on his insistent falsetto.
	Brown's pleasant if largely unremarkable voice rid[es] a set of lean and sultry funk grooves. [Nov 2006, p.149]
	A fairly conservative affair. [Nov 2006, p.101]
	Given Brown's talents, it could have been much more.
	As gorgeous as Sleepyâ€™s voice can be, lyrically the album is lacking.
	[Brown] comes on like a lovable, if genetically engineered, soulman. [Oct 2006, p.95]
	Like fellow hook king/smooth soul singer Nate Dogg, Brown takes most of his solo record and spreads some watered-down slick R&B all over the dance floor and fucks up everyone's game.
	His much-delayed solo debut eschews the kind of risk his productions are known for, and the result turns into one big mash of slow fades waiting for pretty ladies in the video.
	No distinct personality emerges. [Oct 2006, p.132]
	There are soaring hooks aplenty, but there's little to fill the gaping holes in between. [Oct 2006, p.141]
