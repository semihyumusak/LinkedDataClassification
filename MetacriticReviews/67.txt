A genuinely winning collection of sublime, old-school pop.
	To call Bachelor No. 2 a masterpiece may be overstating the matter somewhat, since an album this intimate and unassuming (but not unconfident) doesn't call attention to itself the way self-styled masterpieces do. However, it isn't hyperbole to call it the finest record Mann has made to date.
	Bachelor No. 2 makes good on the promise hinted at by Mann's work on the Magnolia soundtrack. In her mastery of sophisticated melodies and sly turns-of-phrase, Mann brings to mind a number of heralded composers.
	Choosing favourites is almost futile with so much scintillating brilliance on offer.
	Yet another emotion-evoking masterpiece.
	On the evidence of her work here, one would have to say there really isn't any pop-rock composer writing more sophisticated material these days than Mann.
	It's an album of tuneful, intimate pop-rock songs...
	Yet again, Mann's songs concentrate on life gone wrong - but this is timeless stuff.
	A soundtrack nuanced enough for the rippling wit of Mann's lyrics.... These songs are layered and soft-spoken, to be sure, but also confident and rewarding of multiple listens. They are the sound of Aimee Mann growing as a songwriter. Yet the album also features the sound of Aimee Mann grousing about being a songwriter.
	She retains her unique quality to marry upbeat, elegant melodies to witty lyrics that exhibit a disenchanted but honest take on life and love.
	What dignifies her from the pack is her ability to blend accessible and likeable arrangements with messages that are simultaneously straightforward and enigmatic, jovial and pained.
	An imperfect collection of remarkable music.
	The only complaint to be lodged against Bachelor No. 2, other than its partially duplicated track listing, is the mid-tempo groove from which Mann rarely extricates herself.
