Epic and memorable. [Jun 2006, p.188]
	Garcia and company wear their '80s influences proudly throughout, yet bring enough fresh ideas to the mix to avoid being mere slaves to precious retro-fashion.
	The result is a sound of un-epic mopeyness, more surface than interior and arguably more truthful because of it. [Apr 2006, p.84]
	The Black Magic Show is a decent move forward for Elefant. A little more sincerity and a little less swagger might have been nice though.
	So, no matter what you hear from the PR spinners, this album is not groundbreaking.
	And though the desire to not repeat themselves is admirable, one longs for precisely what made the first record such a rare breed. [#13, p.85]
	What's the point of a cheesy goth-pop record that isn't any fun? [May 2006, p.105]
	The guitar work is straight out of the Velvet Underground/Television songbook, and the production begs for comparisons to the Strokes or Interpol. That's not to say being compared to these folks is bad, it's just that those comparisons don't reveal how unimaginative The Black Magic Show really is.
	Elefant's latest is only as deep as its clenched-jaw fake-Brit hooks.
	A dull, droning bit of mainstream rock.
