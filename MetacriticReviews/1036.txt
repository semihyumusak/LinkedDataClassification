These clean, open arrangements tend to make the songs seem catchier than they actually are--the hooks don't grab, they repeat like softened incantations that never quite catch hold--but that does give No Baggage an nice, gentle shimmer that's appealing.

	Former Cranberries woman gives us too much of a good thing.
	She retains a beautiful voice, but this sophomore solo album is undone by a batch of not-so-great songs. She wallows in more melodrama than might be expected, while trying to be self-consciously profound.
	Regardless of how good the voice is, if the music does not follow suit then there's only so far you can get.
	It's grisly. [Sep 2009, p.90]
