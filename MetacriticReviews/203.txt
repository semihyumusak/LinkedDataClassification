A balanced effort that mainly recalls his smooth soul-man Dru Hill days but doesn't forget the power of rump-shaking party jams.
	Sisqo proves he's more than a flash in the pan.
	A vast improvement over a debut that felt as artistically flimsy as the subject matter of ''Thong Song.''
	While fans expecting "Thong Redux" might be disappointed, there are flashes of (dare one say it?) integrity and substance nestled deep in the banging beats and big-time excesses that make Sisqó, well, Sisqó.
	He is undoubtedly a star, but Sisqo will have to work harder than this if he wants his audience to continue loving him as much as he so clearly loves himself. [Sep 2001, p.117]
	It's a messy album, one that's instrumentally inventive, melodically underdeveloped, vocally overcooked and lyrically just plain lazy.
	From production so glossy that you could use it to reapply your lipstick to Sisqo's tortuous way with words, there's little here in the way of sex or sensuality.
	[Crosses] PG-13 thug and subpar Luther Vandross.
	Unfortunately, Return Of Dragon, the follow-up to his debut Unleash The Dragon, comes in way under that bar, with a collection of half-realized lyrics and disappointing hooks.
