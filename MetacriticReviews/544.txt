Like a crisp Xerox of the band's multiplatinum Break the Cycle, with everything sounding bigger, brighter and tighter.
	Those who connect with Staind will likely find this more consistently satisfying than Break the Cycle.
	14 Shades is nominally heavier than the group's two previous albums, though the band tempers its harsher instincts to let Lewis ruminate unmolested. [Aug 2003, p.132]
	The tedious MOR power ballads can't seem to get out of low gear. [13 Jun 2003, p. 96]
	At times this album seems interminable. [Aug 2003, p.116]
	Not memorable enough to be bad, not heavy enough to pack visceral power, most of these songseven radio-friendly ringers like "So Far Away"are indistinguishable from the work of a hundred other bands with misspelled names, hotshot producers, plentiful tattoos, and optional silly facial hair.
	Part of the problem is the thoroughly unimaginative production, a procession of soft-loud modern-rock cliches that breaks up the ho-hum guitar bashing with acoustic interludes and strings.
	Another dollop of rock sludge with a remarkably honest title. [Aug 2003, p.115]
	'14 Shades of Grey' features no standout moments or highlights, just a formulaic, plodding, sixty plus moribund minutes that make this album about an hour too long. Avoid at all costs, even if you're a member of Staind's family.
	Since when is pairing Jewel's poetry outtakes with modern-rock riffs groundbreaking? [Aug 2003, p.102]
