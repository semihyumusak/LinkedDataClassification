They play these songs with passion and swagger.
	Lostprophets still sound hungry and confident, and when they stick the landing, as is the case with the relentless single "Bring 'Em Down," it leaves a mark.
	Weapons feels so full, so intentional, that it's hard not to get dragged into the chorus of people that will doubtless lock arms to these songs live.
	This is a fine album that warrants serious investigation from any and every rock circle.
	When it does flare up at its brightest though, [despite sounding a little burnt out at times] Weapons is exhilarating, a real call to arms from a band that deserves every bit of their continued prevalence.
	For now, this stands as another good if inessential addition to their catalog-a phrase that, for better or worse, applies to the majority of their output.
	"Another Shot" adds tension and atmosphere but a tendency toward the derivative come to the for on synth-centreed gloomfest "Can't Get Enough." [May 2012, p.77]
	'Weapons' has no shortage of big choruses, slick production and crunching riffs but is let down by tired lyrics and too many forgettable songs.
	But as a big comeback for these Welsh titans, it's more lost than prophecy...
	The problem is that when they do attempt something different [as on some parts of this album] things go horribly wrong. [May 2012, p.100]
	Lostprophets has survived in music by understanding what their fans like and catering to them, but with Weapons, the band is firmly entrenched in their comfort zone. While that might excite long-time fans of the band, it provides little to those looking for innovation or excitement out of the genre.
