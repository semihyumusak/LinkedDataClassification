The genius of Wearemonster is that Mueller takes the clarity and mobility of house and synergizes it with the overabundance of melodies, textures, theories, and arrangement schemes found in IDM.
	Record of the year.
	Five years on, We Are Monster finds Raijko Muller so confident and articulate that Rest comes off in comparison like a set of hastily scrawled clutch notes.
	Track-by-track stylistic swerves make the album singular and exciting, but like-minded swerves within the same tracks ultimately give We Are Monster its living, breathing charge.
	Gorgeous... One of the year's best electronic albums. [29 May 2005]
	We Are Monster has the depth if you have the time. Yep, here's a fun record that's a work-for-it, in-the-details record, too.
	We Are Monster is one of those fun albums that sounds great whether you're in the mood to move or just sitting down and listening on headphones as you ride to work on the bus.

	His best music has a kind of timbral vulnerability about it that makes you want to reach out and kiss his computer better.
	Finds Muller reviving a lush disco spirit he once discretely discarded. [Jul 2005, p.92]

	Almost entirely instrumental, but full of a subtlety often obscured by words. [Jul 2005, p.114]
