Diotima is poetry, classical allusion, the consideration of platonic love and our place in history. It is searing shards, intricately arranged, forward-moving, stretching to infinity--lurching, faltering, and then thundering for passages that stop time and levitate your world.
	At their best, they're an overwhelming sonic force, and Diotima is their best album to date.
	It's strange how something so seemingly dense and difficult to fully comprehend upon first listen can be so structurally simple, each instrument clearly defined. It's one of the most fascinating aspects of this peculiar, paradoxical band, and it's something that will keep listeners riveted every time they put out new material.
	Diotima's glory is often in its details. It has fewer stops, starts, and redirections than its predecessors. Rather, the big shifts are now often misleadingly subtle and slight, created more by the way the musicians move against and with each other than how the band moves as a unit.
	Mick Barr's guitar work is hugely impressive, apparently concerned with documenting an infinite number of riffs, but the length of the compositions--often around 12 minutes--rather test the limits of endurance. [Aug 2011, p.90]
