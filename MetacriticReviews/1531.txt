[Kid Cudi carries it] off despite some occasional proggy water-treading. [23 Mar 2012, p.74]
	WZRD's strengths are rooted in Kid Cudi's vocal tone, one that is gripping and melodic despite his quite limited singing ability.
	WZRD, the album, is sort of emo, sort of dream pop, and surely an indulgent effort that surprises with its chemistry and willingness to follow the music.
	It has to be said though that the places where WZRD struggles most are the places where Dot and Cudi leave their hybrid sweet spot and try to go straight rock.
	These bedroom demo-sounding efforts are primitive. {Jun 2012, p.85]
	Wonky vocals and a lack of guile strangle the project, not least on Efflictim, where a terminal aimlessness befits the melodramatic-teen lyric[s]. [Jun 2012, p.115]
	The delicate balance of good-then-bad-then-good-again ideas and taste appears rarely on WZRD.
	The rudimentary guitar, starchy beats and formless synths just sound rough, never fun or spontaneous.
	These directionless, half-baked jams may show a young artist trying to find himself and mature, but he sure isn't there yet.
	The album lacks the urgency of successful rap and rock, instead wallowing in a blah middle ground in its best moments.
