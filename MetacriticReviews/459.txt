I still prefer Bell X1 with just an acoustic guitar and piano, but Bloodless Coup is, at the least, guaranteed to grow your Best of Bell X1 playlist.
	Bloodless Coup gets rocky at points, but there are more than a few scattered gems here.
	This pretty solid record shouldn't disappoint existing fans. However, it's more pleasant than mind-blowing, and you notice the pretty sounds more than the songs themselves.
	Ultimately, Bell X1 only occasionally hit modest highs with Bloodless Coup, but it's the vast lows that make them tough to swallow.
	Were Kirwan's production a bit meatier, Bloodless Coup might be able to overcome the lapses in the band's songwriting.
