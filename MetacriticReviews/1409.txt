Surprisingly bright and confident.
	It is wonderfully all over the musical map.
	Agreeably pervtastic.
	A smartly schizophrenic solo debut filled with the anything-goes dancefloor abandon of the Â‘80s.
	Despite his dirty mind, Chasez has proven to be an adventurous auteur, taking his music to places where NSNYC would never venture.
	This is music that is bent on connecting with the dance floor and won't deny itself anything.
	It's not ''Schizophrenic'''s eclecticism that is so alarming. It's the disc's familiarity in spite of that eclecticism.
	The electronic dance-rock gets the pop job done. [Mar 2003, p.119]
	Unfortunately, that adventurousness also gets Chasez in trouble, as he tries on a few styles that simply don't suit him.
	If the music on Schizophrenic was as awkward as Chavez's singing and stance, it'd be an easy album to dismiss, but what makes it so frustrating is that he has a lot of good music on the album.
	Ultimately, all his genre-grazing makes him seem slippery rather than adventurous.
	On Schizophrenic Chasez attempts to reanimate early-80s electro, disco and new wave back into pop.
	An over-the-top homage to sex whose emotional age equals its bloated number of tracks: 15. [Mar 2004, p.93]
	Ponderous "grooves" that allow him to Prince it up vocally. Tragically, though, his breathy tenor is more Prince Andrew than the Artist Formerly Known As.
	He preens, poses and struts like a self-proclaimed and extremely delusional love god.
	The only area in which JC tops Justin is cheesy double entendres. [Jun 2004, p.96]
