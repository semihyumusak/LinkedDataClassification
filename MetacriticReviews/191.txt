Mraz pushes himself into new territory, creating music that's perilously close to sounding seductive.
	Many of the hacky-sacking grooves on his fourth album settle for snoozy gentility.
	[Mraz] is taking the true-blue pop rock formula and expanding on it in ways other, less competent musicians fail to do in today's world of watered-down songwriting and formulaic radio.
	The songs about heartache don't detract from the optimistic vibe of this 12-song collection.
	He's added more world-music textures to his folk pop, and turned up the blissed-out vibes on Love Is a Four Letter Word.
	The surprise is that it's pretty palatable.
	Filled with platitudes and, eventually, psychobabble, dippy even by Mr. Mraz's standards.
	For a listener who's only been aware of Mraz by reputation, this is no instant-fix point of entry. It relies on past experiences, knowledge of what the artist is capable of rather than anything he delivers with consistency across these 12 songs.
	He's re-engaged the formula of sweet, James Taylor-ish vocals, lyrical inoffensiveness... and a laid-back Jack Johnson-like musicality where 5/6 embraces cruise ship reggae. [May 2012, p.101]
	Even by his own standards this is stupefyingly insipid and pedestrian fare.
