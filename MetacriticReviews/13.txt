Carey's second holiday collection leavens soaring takes on traditional hymns with a handful of funkier originals. [5 Nov 2010, p.71]
	It's not particularly clever, but it is expectedly big: if you're a Carey fan with a stocking that needs filling this year, this'll perk you up better than any alternative speech or sherry trifle could.
	The rest of this album intersperses originals with classics--a respectful "First Noel," an aptly baby-making take on "O Little Town of Bethlehem," and "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)" as routed through a strip club. But nothing beats "All I Want for Christmas Is You," from her 1994 album Merry Christmas," one of the great modern holiday albums.
	Apart from that pair of stiff originals, the whole thing is cheerful and engaging, a worthy sequel to its predecessor.
	It's hard to figure out what's "extra festive" (as the full song title promises) about her "All I Want for Christmas Is You" update, and far easier to determine what's wrong with "Auld Lang Syne" (an awkward dance beat), but the LP's warm heart is in the right place.
	It's an attempted rewind. As such, it's probably one of the most revealing and none-too-flattering approximations of the mindset of a certain sort of adult's Christmas spirit.
	It's 16 years since Mariah Carey's first Christmas album, and there's nothing here to suggest she's developed significantly since then.
	The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You: A "gift" to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell.
