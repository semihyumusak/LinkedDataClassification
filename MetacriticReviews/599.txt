There's a serious hard-rock record lurking deep in Chris Daughtry's clean-shaven skull.
	It all sounds sturdy and fits comfortably down the middle, more dependable than daring.
	Often, Break the Spell harks back to the glory days of the late '80s, when rockers played golden gods all for the sake of video cameras, secure in the knowledge that heavy rotation on MTV and AOR radio would shift millions of CDs.
	This is by-the-numbers arena rock, played with muscular competence by a relatively young band showing off its chops by executing successful formulas.
	Terrific songwriting and clean, polished production.
	Regrettably, Break The Spell never fulfills its mission of delivering an unabashed rock effort and genuine nuggets of musical magic are few and far between.
	Unlike Nickelback, Daughtry offers recognizable human emotions, even if they are rendered clumsily.
	That lack of a distinctive style or voice also means that Daughtry isn't pulling focus from the simple and effective construction of their songs, which is pretty much the only thing they do well.
