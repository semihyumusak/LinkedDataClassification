Mandy Moore is a pop album to be proud of: every song has a good melody, a solid hook, and dramatically improved singing from its star.
	As teen pop goes, it could be a lot worse.
	There's nothing on this album quite like the guilty pleasure of "Candy," her textbook pop number from "So Real."
	But once those fleeting, producer-driven thrills die down, the remainder of the album takes a middle-of-the-road, midtempo stance that goes from covering her age issues on "17" to getting downright silly and insipid about looove with "Saturate Me."
	Sweet as she may be, there's nothing in Mandy Moore's bubblegum world that makes her stand out from the wallpaper of Disneyland background music.
	All the glitter does not make gold: being Nelly Furtado ("Yo Yo") doesn't work, and a couple of Natalie Imbruglia-esque power ballads ("Saturate Me," "Crush") capture Moore in all her adolescent awkwardness, while the uptempo tracks rely on oddly placed Middle Eastern arrangements that don't fit the dance floor.
