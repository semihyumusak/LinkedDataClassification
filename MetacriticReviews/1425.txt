An inspired and diverse 15-song opus.
	While fans of her early-'90s material will find much to embrace here, those that rallied 'round the singer during her hip-hop days may feel lost and abandoned.
	Classic Mariah--for better or worse. [Feb 2003, p.137]
	She has a fine technical voice but the emotional resonance of a car park. [Feb 2003, p.98]
	For most of Charmbracelet, she sticks to a gauzy, breathy, phone-sex coo, muzzling her inner diva until the final verse or a few ultrasonic high notes in the fade-out. [#13, p.92]
	A step ahead of the J-Los of the world; a step behind what may prove to be a career pinnacle.
	Thankfully, there are a few genuinely affecting moments.
	Carey's once glorious voice is all over the place, her rainbow-and-stars lyrics come off like the notebook doodles of a 12-year-old girl, and her song selection is shocking.
	Her voice is damaged, and there's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting. That alone would be disturbing, but since the songs are formless and the production bland --  another reason why the hip-hop announces itself, even though it's nowhere near as pronounced as it has been since Butterfly -- her tired voice becomes the only thing to concentrate on, and it's a sad, ugly thing, making an album that would merely have been her worst into something tragic.
	Tempos plod, and hooks are few.
	A plodding collection of ballads carefully designed to show-off her jaw-dropping vocal range to the fullest.
	Who needs anti-depressants when you have Jesus and schmaltz?
	What's particularly, notably bad here is its production.
