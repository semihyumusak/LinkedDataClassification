Their fusion of melancholy melodies, warm sounds, and truly beautiful vocals is still reliably magical, and the only complaint about Pleasure is that it doesn't last long enough.
	Club 8 may have just made their best record yet (no mean feat in a band with a catalog of great records). It’s true.... this is one of 2015’s best.
	Pleasure is sexy and cool, layered and restrained.
	Only one of this Club’s already modest, eight tiny dancers dare to shake their booty beyond a clock-watching, Cinderella curfew of three minutes. The result is Pleasure delivers a slightly less memorable night on the tiles than it could.
