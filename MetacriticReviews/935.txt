Immediately transforms VHS or Beta from disco revivalists into one of rock's best new bands. [Oct 2004, p.130]
	VHS or Beta has made an album that truly sounds great, and that ought to be enough, though they will probably be called hacks and rip-off artists anyway.
	Kill the instrumentals and one or two filler tracks and you've got one of the best EPs of the year.
	While the band has adeptly navigated the waters of change, a few moments on Night on Fire are simply too slick for their own good.
	What really let’s this collection down is not the quality of the songs – everything about their tunes is well considered and slickly executed – but the production.
	VHS Or Beta hit on a candy-coloured disco-funk previously only thought possible by men wearing daft robot masks. [9 Apr 2005, p.58]
	Still, without the pirate blouses and eyeliner... it's just homage, isn't it? [#12, p.99]
	An uneven but promising debut album that suggests that the group may still create something distinctive.
	VHS or BETA have moved on, like so many bands this year, to pillaging the dance-friendly template of late-80s Cure.
	Clogging their previously supple grooves with banal guitar bluster and noxious singing, VHS Or Beta don't set the Night On Fire; they just dampen your spirits. [Oct 2004, p.148]
	The '80s idolatry is far too forced and distracting, and VHS or Beta comes off as trying too hard to imitate admittedly great, but definitely dated, pop music.
	Night on Fire is going to need a gifted remixer to transform it into the dance-floor-packer it aspires to be.
	The actual effect... is closer to a whinier Duran Duran, with even their slapped bass-driven grooves hobbled by the paper-thin production. [Apr 2005, p.124]
