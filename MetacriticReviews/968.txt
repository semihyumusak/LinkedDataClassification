Hip-hop's own Cheech and Chong boast chemistry that's as powerful as ever on Blackout! 2, this belated follow-up.
	It’s been a long, long decade since Blackout!, but this very worthy sequel proves worth the wait.
	The original deserves the top spot, but think of this as the "Godfather Part II" of reckless boom-bap rap and you've got an idea of how well this Blackout! satisfies.
	This album is a blast of nostalgia that doesn’t sound bitter or even particularly dated.
	The middle-aged MCs have forged an album that reflects their belief that skills will always trump bells and whistles. Don’t mistake it for complacency--blame it on consistency. BO2 passes the smell test.
	The duo has left the cartoon buffoonery behind and drill down on making a rattling, raucous record.
	This dynamic duo comes off as vital as it has in a decade on the highly anticipated sequel to the pair's 1999 collaborative debut, "Blackout!"
	As a sequel, Blackout 2 fails to move things forward; but as a revival, it’s a welcome blast.
	Whilst this album is by no means a classic, and musically the latter parts perhaps not faring as well with repeat listens, it is lifted up by superb lyrics and effortless charisma from the rappers.
	Method Man and Redman don’t recapture the “lightning in a bottle” factor of the very first Blackout!; however, they do give their patiently waiting fans a solid disc of party anthems.
	On their first album in eight years, these How High stars seem every bit the pleasure-seekers they used to be.
