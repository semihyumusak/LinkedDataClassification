Crossing the Rubicon is the sound of a band reaching their potential as artists and it's very satisfying to see and, more importantly, to hear.
	This is a well-rounded album that is as artistically rich as it is sonically pleasing. The Sounds are going to be around for awhile.
	The serious tone is a natural progression for the Sounds but Rubicon's downfall is that it's songs don't linger much after the music stops. [Jul 2009, p.128]
	Front-loaded with buzzy riffs and cutting vocals, the third studio album from this Swedish band is bracingly ambitious, clearly designed to be heard in arenas and stadiums.
	Ultimately, The Sounds probably won't change your world, but they sure can be fun to dance to.
	A few choruses stick, and 'No One Sleeps When I'm Awake' sounds like a solid Heart cover. But the rest? What's Swedish for "meh"?
	The Sounds, sadly, are fatally pledged to sincerity in its most ponderous and uninspired form.
	This is a decently crafted, moderately hooky, fairly vacuous power-pop album, and under the right light, you could do a whole lot worse.
