There’s very little here that fans of Sumner’s prior work absolutely need to hear, but he and his mates appear to be having fun, and their spirit is pretty infectious.
	Of course, new bands have lower expectations than established bands, and while virtually every listener will contrast Never Cry Another Tear with New Order's best work, it has the sweep and grandeur of the group's classic moments.
	Sumner still has a knack for making dopey lyrics sound profound atop guileless Brit-rock jangle and electronic moodiness.
	It's ultimately another product of New Order's comfortable middle age, in which the sound of their golden past gets dependably reproduced.
	Such is the blessing/curse of surviving and thriving in the music business for over 30 years. When you strip all that away, though, Never Cry Another Tear is a promising debut from a new band that’s still searching for an identity all its own.
	The lightness of touch is a pleasant surprise, but not as pleasant as the sound of summery Sumner re-engaging. [Nov 2009, p.101]
	Bernard Sumner delivers decent Enough Post-New order solo platter.
	"Runaway" and "Head Into Tomorrow" sound like the songs that Joy Division might have written if they'd hung out with Ewan MacColl. Good, but slightly disorienting. [Nov 2009, p. 81]
	Unfortunately these familiar sounding highlight aren't enough to raise Bad Lieutenant above the level of any other New Order side-project and they in fact fall some way short of Sumner Electronic.
	This record meanders through a set of passable songs that ultimately decline to move or enthrall you.
	Sumner's fans won't be disappointed, but it feels a bit like a stopgap. [Nov 2009, p.90]
