Bringing mellower, more melodic counterpoints to a core of nu-metal bombast makes Mudvayneâ€™s fifth studio album at times sound clumsy.
	There are some surprises on Mudvayne, like a surprisingly Slash-like guitar solo on "Closer" and the death metal intro to the Slipknot-esque "I Can't Wait," but too much of it is more of the same from the band and its genre.
	Mudvayne has by and large returned to what it does best (or at least do frequently) on its new self-titled album.
	These guys once flailed like a future-prog version of Slipknot (whose Shawn Crahan served as executive producer on L.D. 50), but now their doomy riff-o-rama comes equipped with mellow-bellow butt-rock choruses.
