She has a keen, finely honed pop instinct all her own.
	When the production and the outside songwriters stay out of her way, Bowersox expertly works the territory between folk and country.
	All in all, Farmer's Daughter is better than you might expect, which isn't to say it's great. Too many tracks aim straight for the middle.
	Her debut album, Farmer's Daughter, is consistent with the singer-songwriter's public persona, then, because it finds her attempting to rise above production values that are fundamentally at odds with what she does well.
	If she had the right co-writers, the kind who could pull melodies out of her sincere strumming and down-home jamming -- the kind the whole American Idol  empire was designed to bring into the equation -- Farmer's Daughter would deliver on Bowersox's promise instead of sounding like a local singer/songwriter performing on a stage she's too modest to fill.
	If Farmer's Daughter feels like one of the most genuine Idol-contestant debuts yet, it's also one of the dullest, with Bowersox hitting every note exactly the way you expect her to.
