What's surprising about the best cuts from the 15-track set is how much heat the Police frontman and his varied collaborators create.
	Mostly, with its wintry hush and flurries of harmonies, the album evokes the title, a not unpleasant vision of contemplatively gazing out a window encrusted with frost in a thick Irish wool sweater drinking a steaming cup of cider.
	While impeccably executed, as ever, a little more warmth and a little less ego wouldn't have gone amiss. [Dec 2009, p. 126]
	It's more accessible than that lute album, but -barring the sole Sting composition, the lovely "The Hounds Of Winter" - it will baffle all but the hardiest Police fan. [Jan 2010, p. 126]
	It's a holiday album for people who have never wanted to hear a holiday album, let alone own one.
	Using top folk musicians means everything is expertly crafted, but Sting's Christmas pudding is over-egged.
