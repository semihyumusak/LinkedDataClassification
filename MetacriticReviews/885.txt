Tricky hasn't planted his flag on any new territory, but he has gotten a stronger grasp of what has made him such an intriguing and important artist in the last decade. [#6, p.90]
	The Trickster's best record in years. [Aug 2003, p.119]
	The album bristles with a new urgency. [Sep 2003, p.100]
	13 avant-pop gems evocative of Pere Ubu and Talking Heads. [Jun 2003, p.96]
	He's a full-fledged alternative auteur, skipping effortlessly from hypnotic electronics to refracted torch songs to balls-out alt-rock. [Aug 2003, p.134]
	So, while this might not be Tricky at his total best, it may well be the best you're likely going to get out of him.
	Quirky, detail-rich arrangements nodding at dub and death metal. [Jun 2003, p.108]
	This record is still an example of mediocrity.
	Vulnerable is Tricky's most accessible album since Maxinquaye, but it has neither that album's shock of the new nor its enduring appeal.
	What once sounded like the future's music a decade ago just sounds creepy and dated now.
	Tricky's problem is that the future has caught up with him. [#233, p.71]
	Very much Tricky business as usual, the sound of a staggering talent laid-up with the longest case of musical flu in history.
	By the end of the album, Tricky returns to acting on his worst impulses, stumbling through hackneyed sonics and wincing lyrics.
	The year-round sunshine [of new home L.A.] seems to have induced creative lethargy, sapping the adventure that elevated his last album. [Jun 2003, p.106]
	Without the apocalyptic beats and emotional storm clouds that were once his trademarks, Vulnerable makes Tricky all but dispensable. [Aug 2003, p.156]
	Vulnerable has a cheap sound and a cut and paste feel from beginning to end and is hard to shake. [#5, p.110]
	Tricky without edges and paranoia is freakin' dull. [Sep 2003, p.118]
