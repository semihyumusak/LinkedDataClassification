This is a determined little bastard of a record by a band in a bug-eyed, rhythmic sweat, who know its time to come out with their guns blazing.
	This is grade-A grade-B pop metal. [Oct 2004, p.120]
	The new songs are thrashing hard rock that always pays attention to melody.
	Almost every song features a skull-rattling groove and one or two darkly melodic hooks. [16 Sep 2004, p.79]
	His band remains unsubtly one-dimensional... but Shaddix funnels a newfound sensitivity into gashing, coarsely melodic emo-metal that aches as much as it breaks. [Oct 2004, p.126]
	Too many of the [tracks] here lack depth. [3 Sep 2004, p.77]
	With Getting Away With Murder, Papa Roach offer fans of this sound an appropriately hard punch in the face. But there's a hollow sound as the bones collapse, because all that's supporting it is expensive art direction and a big scaffold of clichés.
	It seems Shaddix still writes most of his songs in purple ink in diaries with little locks on. [28 Aug 2004, p.56]
