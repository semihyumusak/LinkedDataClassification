An appreciation for the heart, humor and no-bullshit directness of the very best hip hop is all that's required. [May 2004, p.108]
	It's a testament to hip-hop's liberating ability to transcend geography that a Californian, a brilliant young producer from North Carolina, and a New York-based independent label have united for an album that says more in 35 fat-free minutes than most rappers will ever say.  [24 Mar 2004]
	More prosaic and profane than many of his labelmates. [May 2004, p.108]
	Murs' strongest all-around album.
	9th [Wonder]'s impassioned beatwork's sole shortcoming is there's not enough of it, as this album runs less than 40 minutes. [Apr 2004, p.83]
	This is one explosive package no hip hop loving home should be without. [Aug 2004, p.92]
	Murs fails to gain any ground regarding his approach to rhyming and lyrical  ingenuity. Yet, Murs 3:16 is far superior to The End of the Beginning,  due to the tight and refreshing skills of producer 9th Wonder.
	Murs' command of his rhyme scheme -- and the uniformly banging, soul-drenched beats of his labelmates -- make this one of the most engaging hip-hop records of the young year, even at just over a half-hour.
	What sets him apart from other, more gifted MCs is the refreshing degree of naked self-examination and social commentary he brings to the table.
	Even while The 9th Wonder's production tends to lag, Murs is worth listening to on every song.
	He's effectively run aground in the middle of the alt-rap landscape.
	Striding purposefully forward on vaguely cinematic fanfares and catchy soul-queen loops, Murs reveals more than you want to know about his sex life. [May 2004, p.130]
