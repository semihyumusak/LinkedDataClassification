Make the most of dead Son Rising, as its diversity is its strength. [Nov 2011, p.103]
	[A] satisfying compilation with its lugubrious and luxurious electronic introspection created by an artist once again near the height of his powers.
	Dead Son Rising is a dark experimental work that reminds us why Trent Reznor is an obvious fan.
	While Dead Son Rising isn't likely to propel him back into the mainstream, it's an impressively bold affair that ensures his cult status will remain intact.
	Numan might not have the most up-to-date operating system, but the old cyborg is still good for a couple of kicks.
	Dead Son Rising is neither terrible nor extraordinary.
	A collection of offcuts revamped in the industrial style that has characterised his recent work--isn't [a latter-day masterpiece that will spread his appeal beyond his hyper-devoted fanbase].
	Dead Son Rising feels watery and without a center; it reinforces Numan's legacy, rather than his potential.
	It almost hurts to pan this album but probably not as much as listening to the whole thing a fourth time.
