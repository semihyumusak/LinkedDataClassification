Thecontrollersphere is another thrilling addition to the Of Montreal catalog, but it's hardly a welcoming entry point for those unaccustomed to the depraved yet tantalizing world of Kevin Barnes.  For longtime fans though, this EP represents another exhilarating turn from one of America's most singular musicians.
	thecontrollersphere may be an album of toss-offs, but they're proud ones, earning that status by virtue of robust exploration rather than any real deficiency.
	"Holiday Call" and "Black Lion Massacre" aren't among Barnes' best songs, but they are bold and show that he's an artist who is eager to challenge himself rather than stick to what has become a very successful formula.
	Let's not pretend that an excellent lead track and a handful of perfectly agreeable additional songs is bad going for an odds'n'sonds EP. Still, in both its strengths and weaknesses, thecontrollorsphere is suggestive of a band in need of some renewal.
	While more or less a collection of bastardized leftovers from the False Priest sessions, longtime fans should rejoice as the band finally rekindles their longtime relationship with unpredictability.
	Few would argue that Of Montreal leader Kevin Barnes lost his freakiness in the feverish pursuit of soul-rock nirvana, but this five-track EP of outtakes from last year's False Priest nevertheless hedges his bets.
	As said, the songs benefit from being taken out of context and as much as that leads to just picking and choosing the moments worth going back for, the process of listening to the EP as a whole can almost be disheartening as much as it is unrewarding.
	Nothing here is must=-hear, but true fans will enjoy sorting through of Montreal's influences and musical thought process as they prepare for the next full-length album. [May 2011, p.85]
	It's pretty much what you'd expect, which makes it both essential for Of Montreal devotees and nothing all that special.
