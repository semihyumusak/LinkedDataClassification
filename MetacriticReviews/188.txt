Breaking Kayfabe is a record that demands and deserves undivided attention, its creator fashioning a brain-searing patchwork of ragged rap, electronic flourishes and truncated rhythms.
	Breaking Kayfabe is a cohesive set of songs, backpacker in the best of senses, smart and witty and provocative, experimental and well-produced, but at the same time very raw and very real-sounding.
	His vivid, scattershot rhymes are clever without being cryptic, and his techno-tinged beats never veer off into tuneless arhythmia.
	Pembertonâ€™s crafted a uniquely engaging sonic statement that stands on its own legs.
	Breaking Kaytabe is without a doubt one of the most impressive releases you'll hear all year, regardless of genre.
	Raised in a library of music and having already dissected his influences, Rollie takes confident first steps as Cadence Weapon.
	A dense and abrasive record of astonishing precocity, which, if it has a fault, is only that it occasionally offers brute intensity in excess of the impact Pemberton's razor-sharp verses. [Oct 2008, p.87]
	Too exciting for the underground (maybe), too weird for the overground (hopefully not), he deserves to be heard by both.
	This superior debut from Alberta rapper Roland Pemberton cuts adroitly from Oliver Square's booty shaking electro to the spare funk of Black Hand. [Oct 2007, p.101]
