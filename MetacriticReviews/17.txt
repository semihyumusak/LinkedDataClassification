Well worth the wait.
	A stunning return to form.
	Toying with sound and rhythm, noise and melody, Square is less minimalist than Hope, more fractured than Second.
	The Massachusetts trio's newfound love of meandering atmospherics plays like a Broken Social Scene doppelganger dozing off in its own sonic wanderings.
	Those whose favorite form of Wheat is the aforementioned major-label effort, or even the elegant chamber pop of Hope and Adams, might consider this willful album an exercise in self-indulgent noise, but in the context of the duo's career as a whole, it sounds much more like a deliberate stylistic retrenchment.
	[Wheat's] most rousing collection. [Jun 2007, p.97]
	The results will gladden devotees of fractured, footsore indie-rock. [Jul 2007, p.127]
	This album is a detour from the straightforwardness of Per Second, which means that comparatively it also often feels disjointed and uncomfortable.
	Wheat's scrappy though sometimes endearing fourth album is clearly a stylistic protest against their only major-label release, 2003's bland, vexed, much-delayed-by-Sony Per Second, Per Second, Per Second . . . Every Second.
	There are dozens of bands that do this kind of stuff better, including Wheat themselves.
	If the idea was to shore up the band's indie roots, Wheat has succeeded in the worst possible way.
	File this under 'disappointing'.
	It fails by dressing up its prettier moments in unnecessary clatter, whereas the noisier bits are already unnecessary. [Summer 2007, p.86]
	The entire album reeks of unnecessary ostentation.
