Trilla's strongest moments arrive when Ross lets more flamboyant wordsmiths play off his rhymes. [15 Mar 2008, p.77]
	I suspect as Ross continues to evolve as a lyricist there will be even more of a message in his music, but in the meantime the production and guest stars on "Trilla" make for an effective album that shows Ross has yet to tap into his full potential.
	There are too many throwaway songs and guests (Nelly?), but Ross can still expose all the thrills of Miami vice.
	Clunky, overblown, and decidedly Ross.
	His best asset is his persona, which he doesn’t stray from until the last track, allowing the album to come together more fluidly and coherently than you might expect.
	The huge guest list is also a plus since Ross would have a hard time carrying this album on his own, but when surrounded by talent he pushes a little harder and comes up with a handful of rhymes that aren't tired or clichéd.
	On album two, his focus switches from coke to cash as he booms about his fleet of Maybachs (on the soaring T-Pain synthfest 'The Boss') and prepaying his baby daughter’s college tuition.
	The beats are terrific--the problem here is the MC.
	If Ross spouts myriad clunkers, his cadence is at least smooth and his voice cushiony, and so if it's possible to ignore the rapper and focus on the production, Trilla becomes an enjoyable listen.
	Like any good corporate-mandated sequel, it reprises the strengths of its original product with as little variation as possible, to predictably diminished returns.
	Rick Ross is pretty much incapable of going more than 30 seconds with out using the word boss--too bad, because Justice League turn out three monsterous cruisetime tracks toward the end. [June 2008, p.63]
	Trilla, Rick Ross's inexplicable second album, is every bit a fatty contemporary American disaster.
