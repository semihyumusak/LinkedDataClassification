Hood have crafted a singular meeting of modern electronics, carefully layered arrangements and more conventional rock melancholia. [Dec 2001, p.96]
	Uniformly excellent.... Few, if any, British bands are making music quite like this right now.
	With Cold House, Hood provide evidence that their time in the sun is long overdue. [Dec 2001, p.84]
	Takes the scattered clicks and beats of Autechre and combines it with the tunefulness of Spiritualized.... Very rewarding.
	Cold House takes a fantastic batch of songs and intelligently mixes in cutting edge electronic elements a la Autechre and Nobukazu Takemura, a couple of west coast underground hip-hop artists, and some delicate backing arrangements, and creates one of the most innovative releases of the past year.
	Another step in Hood's continually compelling sonic evolution. [#52, p.89]
	A hypnotic dream-map of astral drift and spac-age chamber music, textured jazztronica and technoid pulse. [Dec 2001, p.106]
	Tender melodies, modern scrapes and traditional beauty merge into a gently unfolded whole that touches the soul with its silky aesthetics.
	Experimental hip-hop and moppish guitar pop *can* go hand in hand. [#90, p.118]
	It's definitely a great step for the group.
	Just as you've got Cold House pegged as a way-underground cousin to Kid A and Vespertine, another element comes in from far left-field: hip-hop. [Dec 2001, p.163]
	This is, quite possibly, one of the finest releases of last year, and certainly one of the most overlooked.
	Out there, but compelling all the same. [#184, p.137]
	Elegant, downbeat orchestral pop songs.
