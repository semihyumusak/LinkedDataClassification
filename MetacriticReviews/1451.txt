Nelly sounds more convincing and appealing on Suit [than on Sweat]. [17 Sep 2004, p.75]
	Nelly pushes crossover so far on a few of these tracks a few of his more hardcore fans may be turned off, but frankly since this is a concept album songs like "N Dey Say" are what I expected from "Suit."
	Nice and musically diverse.
	In his world, being grown and sexy doesn't mean being complacent - it means being curious, maybe even brave.
	Granted, Nelly's rapping here is more restrained and insubstantial than ever, but when you have a cast of collaborators like this, the actual rapping is beside the point -- these are fun songs, plain and simple, and wonderfully catchy to boot.
	In these moments of reflection, Nelly emerges as a serious songwriter who moves the mind as effectively as he does the body. [26 Sep 2004]
	As much as Nelly likes to portray himself as everybodys favourite fun-filled club star, Suit suggests that writing thoughtful, intelligent and enduring R&B is where his heart really lies.
	Both [discs] combine into one excellent combo platter, proving Nelly as one of the most clever and effusive pop minds around.
	There are plenty of surprises on Suit. [Oct 2004, p.184]
	By turns sensual and despondent. [Oct 2004, p.126]
	Anchored by predigested melodic hooks, Nelly's songs seem composed with the sole intention of ending up as your next ringtone. [Combined review of both discs]
	Sadly, Suit, is exactly what it purports to be: the business-side of a duo of albums. And, in the world of pop, theres nothing worse than sounding like business as usual.
	Its fizz fades fast. [Dec 2004, p.142]
	Hackneyed songs grind drearily.
	Each CD is crammed to a full 50 minutes with some of the most heinous crimes against good taste since Wham's "Wham Rap! '86." [Joint review of both discs.]
	Suit represents Nelly going smooth and seductive for an entire LP, and it is about 9,000 times as bad as that sounds. [2 Oct 2004, p.63]
