About as far removed from Dire Straits as it can be.
	Upon repeated listens, there are plenty of musical nuances to enjoy.
	Without ostentation, The Ragpicker's Dream draws his major sources together: R&B, country, North-East folk. [Oct 2002, p.106]
	If his subject matter is getting stranger, however, his semiacoustic music is comfortingly familiar and expert. [#11, p.135]
	An album that can express itself only through understatement.
	Dig deeper, and you'll find rich arrangements more reminiscent of Knopfler's soundtrack work. [Oct 2002, p.110]
	The Ragpickers Dream is a restrained success, at least on its own terms. It may not please some of Knopflers old Money For Nothing fans, but at this stage, hes obviously not trying to.
	A decent album of roots-tinged songs that showcases his terse guitar style and detached vocals to solid if unspectacular effect. [Nov 2002, p.122]
