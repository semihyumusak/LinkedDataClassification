Joan of Arc have once more surpassed themselves as artists.
	Rarely is so-called "difficult music" so rewarding, and rarely is it so simple.
	People tend to like Joan of Arc when they play songs, but get all worked up and annoyed when the band stretches out with the experimental stuff. This record is a bunch of the stuff that would have pissed off that latter group of people had the music been bunched in with So Much Staying Alive...
	The cache of "weird" songs on Rape Fantasy is better than the tracks collected on Staying Alive.
	Painfully pretentious, plodding, self-indulgent drivel. [Jun 2003, p.97]
