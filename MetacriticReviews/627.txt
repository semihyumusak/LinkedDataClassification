China is terrifically rewarding.
	Everything here roars. [May 2006, p.108]
	Hatfield tears through 12 songs, posturing and pouting over caustic guitars and leaving her singalong hooks raw and unedited. [13 Aug 2005]
	Her songs still revolve mostly around the adolescent hell of looking right and pleasing jerky guys, a shtick that would be old if Hatfield, well into her thirties, didnâ€™t genuinely sound as if she were still living through it.
	Made in China is a raw, angry album that is difficult to endure at points due to the emotionally naked lyrics, but the lo-fi, almost punky, music is a perfect fit.
	There's clarity visible beneath the waterline, sharp lyrics and even some hummable choruses. [Oct/Nov 2005, p.141]
	The sour largely overwhelms the sweet on this set of metal sludge, repetitive tunes, and purposefully ugly vocal effects. [12 Aug 2005, p.77]
	Hatfield has nothing new to say besides "You don't know what it's like to be perfect," and it might explain her perfect-person tendency toward carelessness-- guitar solos, grating vocals, overdone crabbiness-- all signs that point to thinly veiled midlife crisis rock.
	A confused, sloppy, childish, conflicted mess.
	Made In China soon disintegrates into demo-quality slackness. [8 Sep 2005, p.116]
	The blandest rock n' roll record possible.
