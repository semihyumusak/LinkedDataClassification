[An] especially forceful and cohesive album. [12 Nov 2004, p.120]
	Watch out for this guy’s next album, because I can guarantee it will contain a Top 40 hit. Go ahead and listen to him now so as to impress your friends later.
	Arthur is in a class of his own and Our Shadows Will Remain is a monstrous, memorable outing, his finest moment in a career that is thus far full of them.
	The album is so intricate, rich and multilayered that it’s difficult to do justice to its overall sound.
	Whether the songs get a grimy edge or sweet touch, the textured album leaves Shadows as a bright spot in the singer-songwriter genre.
	Arthur's delicious art is a potent, concentrated thing. [Oct 2004, p.96]
	If at first the songs feel ordinary, perseverance reveals the haunting quality of Arthur's imagery, and the rich patina of his careworn voice.
	It might be wearing, were it not for the fact that his voice... is a thing of considerable power. [Aug 2005, p.122]
	Here, as on previous albums, Arthur demonstrates his gift for emotionally direct songwriting, but the specifics often escape his attention.
	These dozen lushly orchestrated songs will give further ammunition for those shouting his praises off their rooftops. [#13, p.97]
	Sturdier production and straightforward songwriting make a strong backbone for someone once lauded for his mysticism.
	His most accessible and engaging CD to date.
	The best of Shadows lives in murky half-light where texture matters as much as melody. [Oct 2004, p.112]
	Too eclectic for his own good, perhaps? [Sep 2005, p.100]
