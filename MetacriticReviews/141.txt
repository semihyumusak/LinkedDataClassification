Crusty, jarring and still as acerbic as ever, this is Cancer Bats at their best.
	If the album has a flaw, it's the excessive length — 14 tracks in 45 minutes should have been shaved down to ten in 30. But overall, this is a solid effort from a band with a lot to offer fans of aggressive rock who aren't too worried about categories.
	Through it all, they retain their fundamental hardcore power-chug while vocalist Liam Cormier gives his most diverse screaming/growling/speaking performance yet. [May 2010, p.105]
	Cancer Bats’ tendency to veer towards the metallic might shock those unaccustomed to having a sweaty Torontonian screaming blue murder in their faces. But persevere and it reveals itself as a selection of dark, enjoyably violent treats.
	This freewheeling third record is picthed just the right side of sobriety. [May 2010, p.112]
	While there is some filler, some of the best Cancer Bats songs can be found here and that alone makes this worth checking out, even if it isn’t a gigantic departure.
	Bears, Mayors, Scraps & Bones is an impressive album from Cancer Bats, having the most potential of their three albums to attract new fans with its genre variety and dynamic compositions.
