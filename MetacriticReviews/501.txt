What Trinity lacks in consistency, it more than makes up for in ambition and eclecticism, as Slum Village careens assuredly from aggressive, sinister dance-rap to funky minimalism to blissed-out soul.
	With an uplifting mellow party vibe, ear-catching rhymes and a Zen-like minimalist style that takes decades of music and points them toward the future, Trinity stands tall on its own.
	Trinity is a more diverse album than their last, but there are times when the songs feel too disjointed.
	By combining the cinematic ambition of Massive Attack with A Tribe Called Quest's soul-clap minimalism, Slum Village step forward on Trinity -- even if, at sixty-nine sprawling minutes, it could have used some serious pruning.
	Though T3 and Baatin's verbal syncopations punctuate Trinity's big-bottomed sound, their words are consistently trite. [Sep 2002, p.248]
	Even with all the enjoyable tracks, many of the choices SV makes with their production will keep some fans scratching their heads.
	Despite a bloated track listing and a mostly overblown concept, though, Trinity (Past, Present and Future) is an excellent statement from one of the most mature groups in the rap underground.
	As a document of solid, if not always spectacular, post-modern hip-hop that dips into soul and R&B, Trinity is worth the money. [Aug 2002, p.82]
	After a few tracks, it becomes increasingly more difficult to ignore the pathetic lyrics and boring flows-- even the production seems redundant, bland, and horribly imitative and regressive.
	Some interesting musical touches and flashes of intelligence remain, but muddy mixing and one-paced production make this an overlong bore. [Nov 2002, p.114]
	Trinity is almost perversely uninvolving on first listen. [Sep 2002, p.90]
	Trinity drags from track to heavily blunted track like a doped-up Tribe Called Quest, vainly searching for the group's warm and soulful vibe of yesteryear.
