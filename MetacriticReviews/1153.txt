The seventh Lil Jon album, which has been delayed for several years because of contract squabbles and other distractions, feels warmly nostalgic.
	It's a scattershot set of tracks that just barely fit together, but take into consideration the label problems and legal issues the producer has faced since the album's conception, and it becomes a scruffy mess you just might cheer on.
	The set is worth a listen for its high-energy club bangers and colorful guest appearances, but it holds extra baggage. Gratuitous interludes and an overall lack of Lil Jon's rhymes hurt the would-be dance disc.
	If you're looking for lyrical greatness, you'll be disappointed. If you want an album filled with nothing but trunk-rattling beats you'll be disappointed. However, those with tastes that shift from crunk to pop to rock and back to crunk should be rather satisfied with this release.
	It takes Jon's defining affectations and compresses them, creating a completely frenzied environment, all hoarse shouting and pimp chalices spilling over. It's through this constant level of noise that Crunk Rock drowns out all complaints, its overbearing silliness putting it almost beyond criticism.
