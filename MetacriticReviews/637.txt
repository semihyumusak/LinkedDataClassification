The now-three-piece group proves they haven't lost their ability to blend superb pop hooks with dance beats. [Sep 2007, p.131]
	These are high-flying songs in search of a place to land, and the warmth and seeming innocence of Pfunder's voice combined with all the familiar electro-disco trappings make this a record worth hearing for anyone not ready to let the past go without a fight.
	The result is like if "Sam's Town" worked, without a sign of embarrassing wordplay, conceptual grandeur, or annoying moustaches. The words are blessedly innocuous, leaving the grandiosity to the sound alone.
	VHS or Beta  have hit a spot-on balance between danceable rock and infectious Top 40 formula. [Summer 2007, p.77]
	Comets sounds best when Craig Pfunder trains his fake English accent on a chorus with a hot melody.
	It's quite a bit slicker and sonically feels as if it could fill an arena--but lacks personality. [Oct 2007, p.172]
	Had there maybe been a more analytical approach to creating shamelessly tricked-out pop songs, maybe some of Brings on the Comets would sound more successful.
	It was a mistake for VHS or Beta to subjugate their dance beat into a perfunctory structure for the guitars to smash against; the riffs sound like they're there for their own sake, biding their time and waiting for a moment of catchiness that never really arrives.
	Their third albums smells less of revivalist chic than tribute-band nostalgia. New wave knockoffs have rarely sounded so old.
	VHS's tardy follow-up, Bring On The Comets, might as well have stayed in bed.
	Bring on the Comets is ultimately a bland regression. [Sep 2007, p.138]99
	For the most part, singer-songwriter Craig Pfunder doesn't justify the presence of vocals and lyrics.
