While "The Oracle" is certainly familiar, it still sounds fresh enough and well worth the wait for fans who prefer their Godsmack served up straight.
	Fifth album The Oracle is a much welcome return to form, at least in energy. Ten tracks, no ballads, no bullshit. [May/Jun 2010, p.95]
	Those fans seeking a return to Godsmack's roots will not be disappointed; for others, the sound may be a retrenchment because there was no place else for them to go. The only undebatable thing is that The Oracle is the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut.
	Though built mainly with recycled material, "The Oracle" has fresh moments, such as the scrappy delivery of "What If?" and the up-tempo snap of "War and Peace."
	The dense guitars and plaid shirts scream "grunge redux," but the attitude is pure hair metal circa 1987. [Aug 2010, p.116]
	The Oracle is not terrible, just thoroughly second-rate.
	The Oracle sounds like it was written on autopilot, with the band ticking off the ingredients that made previous albums sell with out injecting any fire or imagination. [3 Jul 2010, p.51]
