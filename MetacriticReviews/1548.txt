This is a really special record.
	Simply put, this album sounds absolutely huge, its relentless attention to detail eclipsed only by the stunning emotional power it conveys.
	There's an organic component that coexists along with the machines, giving them a warmth few acts have been able to unearth. [#11, p.93]
	Although at times M83 evoke Jean-Michel Jarre or Air, this is far from being an album of Franco-synth by numbers; it is the layered, hypertextual futurism of My Bloody Valentine and Brian Eno which seeps through the electronic Gallic gauze as the most palpable influences.
	In Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, M83 have created an ethereal electronic masterpiece, and one which, thankfully, doesn't sound like a relic from the Warp Records back catalogue.
	Immersive and woozy, brittle yet supple, a twittering, throttling piper of spectral drones. [Jul/Aug 2004, p.126]
	Few artists can master the trick of capturing ambience and atmosphere without resorting to cliche. M83 are among the few.
	M83 is a keyboard band of the best kind: one with nuance, tone, thrash, and color.
	A wonderful surprise.
	The whole much greater than its parts, Dead Cities is creation imbued and then muted again.
	While I don't think that it's quite the groundbreaking release that many have given it credit for, there are definitely moments during the 12-track release that I feel like the group has cracked into something unique and downright amazing.
	That [M83] achieve My Bloody Valentine beauty through antiquated analog rigs is an achievement in itself. [#64, p.100]
	A Herculean instrumental epic of beautiful depth, staggering grandiosity and extraterrestrial soundscapes. [#7]
	Dead Cities reinforces the French pair's penchant for distorted vocals and cheesy synthesizers, but the tracks here ultimately add up to far less than the sum of their assorted parts.
	As monumental as Dead Cities sounds in parts, its uniformity proves oppressively stirring after just a few tracks.
