Is it cheesy? Kind of. But sometimes your musical diet can use a little extra dairy.
	Calling the World might not be radically inventive, but its solid songcraft and playful shout-outs to rock history are a lot of fun.
	Tossing aside the overbearing Weezer influence from Rooney's debut, singer-songwriter-Hollywood kid Robert Schwartzman -brother of Jason, cousin of Nicolas Cage - adopts the "poor me" lyrical stance perfected by the likes of The Eagles and Toto on Calling The World.
	There aren't enough original ideas here to know if Rooney can shine as a relevant, modern rock band.
	Things get slightly clunky when the tempo slows and they stretch for drama, but there’s a growing self-awareness here that keeps Rooney within its comfort zone, which, refreshingly, is comforting more often than not.
	It's even more hook-slathered and fetchingly tuneful than the first.

	It’s all very sweet and likeable, too much in fact. The shtick is so cloying that its sentiments melt on contact. This is the fundamental flaw of Rooney’s work on Calling the World - the effect of their craft, delivery, and emotion disappears as soon as it arrives.
	In the end, Calling the World left me bored as hell.
	There’s just very so little of merit here--glazed pop-rock staggers into itself as the whole album washes past without you realising.
