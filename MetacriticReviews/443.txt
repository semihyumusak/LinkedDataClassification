Operatic in scope, ruthlessly ambitious in its range, The Paper Chase have dropped one the most unique and substantive records of the year.
	It’s a passionate and at times painful aural experience as a whole, but it’s one that has to be taken from start to finish.
	Presents more of the same disconcerting, cacophonous, yet strangely melodic and catchy music that always seems to find frontman John Congleton on the verge of going absolutely insane.
	The whole glorious mess creates a dramatic Wagnerian opera that's (barely) held together by Congleton's yelping. [Aug 2006, p.206]
	Now You Are One Of Us is worth checking out for its amazing production alone.
	Sure, 2004's God Bless Your Black Heart may be the Paper Chase's best album in terms of accessibility, but the band has taken its usual dark angle and bent it another hundred or so degrees toward further obtuseness.
	It's so gleefully over-the-top that even the most absurd and token-tortured lyrics neatly circumvent being taken at face value.
	While imperfect,  Now You Are One Of Us is packed with poignant ideas and disturbingly beautiful moments.
	It's a well-constructed and performed album that sounds great on the stereo.
	I admire the band's unorthodox approach to its music and its combination of disparate rock and non-rock elements.... That said, I will probably never be able to listen to this entire album in a single sitting.
