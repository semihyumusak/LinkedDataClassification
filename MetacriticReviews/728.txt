Everyone knows this girl just wants to have fun, but Cyndi Lauper means business on her new album, Memphis Blues, a guest-studded trip toward Beale Street.
	Apart from the odd incongruous squawk or squeal, she handles blues standards like How Blue Can You Get, Romance In The dark and Wild Women Don't Get The Blues with real empathy. [Dec 2010, p.108]
	Though her voice is thin and lacking in bluesy grit and sinew – this is especially evident as she alternates lines with feline, growling guest Ann Peebles on Rollin' and Tumblin' – she gets inside the songs, and that makes the album work.
	Of all her detours, Memphis Blues' feels the most misguided. It's a pet project, and might actually sound terrific if rendered live in a cozy jazz joint.
	In the end, while Memphis Blues does have some fine moments, the uneven ones makes it feel like a squandered opportunity at a popular comeback.
	Memphis Blues is a disappointment because it doesn't play to Lauper's considerable strengths. She remains a vocalist of phenomenal depth and power, but she sounds lost in this material and in these arrangements.
	Lauper's teeth-itching screech does no favours to the likes of :Shattered Dreams," "Down So Low" and "Crossroads." [Dec 2010, p.98]
	It makes her Christmas album look like OK Computer. Horrible. [Dec 2010, p.112]
