There is no visible rust on Game Tested, Streets Approved, Rob's first album in six years.
	All in all, the flow is the same, the beats are a little different, and the person is a little more scarred and a little more wise than we last saw him.
	With his gruff tone and no-nonsense flow, Rob holds down 14 tracks with only one guest appearance without any problems.
	Ultimately, Game Tested & Street Approved is all about tracks three through eight, with the rest of it meandering through various forms of decent and straight up awful.
	There is more to Black Rob than "Whoa," but there is nothing that quite lives up to it on Game Tested, Streets Approved.
