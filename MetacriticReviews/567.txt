More than any other recording issued by this excellent band, Leucocyte captures the art of music making at the moment of conception.
	One thing we do know after listening to Leucocyte--the Esbjorn Svensson Trio's grandest achievement--is that its leader had much more to say, much more to explore.
	Profound and intense, they had reached a level of interaction most bands can only dream of. Svensson's loss goes deep.
	This is refreshing if not always easy or fun listening.  E.S.T. could have continued making contemplative or gospel-tinged acoustic jazz in the Jarrett/ECM mode (the brief “Ajar” here is a fine example), but Svensson and his group have been frying bigger fish from the start.
	Svennson was noted for his freethinking mixing of pop and jazz genres and styles, which is why the work on Leucocyte feels fresh and enticing for just about any audience.
