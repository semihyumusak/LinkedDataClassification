Dr. No's Ethiopium combines two of the best things on Earth: Egyptian jazz and hip hop. This is a fantastic album, and one that improves upon "Dr. No's Oxperiment."
	It’s rich; despite the fact that the cuts are short and sweet, each represents any number of possibilities for repurposing and restyling.
	Obviously, though, the greatness of this record goes beyond its transitions and production “tricks.” Aside from the aforementioned standout “Xcalibur”, Ethiopium is brimming with repeat-worthy cuts.
	Ethiopium is an instant classic that reveals its true essence after every listen, and as such, will only reward those who prove worthy.
	Oh No knows just what he's got to work with on this album, and in finding every angle he can for an incredible array of source material, he's made that much more of a case for his own style, too.
