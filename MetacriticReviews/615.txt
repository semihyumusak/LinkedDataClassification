What sounded austere on Fan Dance sounds simple on A Boot and a Shoe, and it's the differing inferences of those two adjectives that makes all the difference.
	The great beauty of the record, though, is how repeated listenings peel back once-unheard layers, how PhillipsÂ’ voice develops a deeper resonance with each spin, and how the deceptive simplicity of the recording gradually fades to reveal carefully scripted movements and moments.
	With deft, powerful strokes, the singer-songwriter chisels emotions, impressions, yearnings and regrets, giving these 13 songs exactly as much room as they need and no more.
	Phillips flirts with Depression-era stylings and pre-World War II cabaret to brilliantly convey a chaotic world of subdued rage. [7 May 2004, p.86]
	A disc of graceful beauty.
	Small, perfectly formed and wonderfully refreshing. [Jun 2004, p.105]
	There are hints of blues and gospel, but most of the songs could come from a rustic cabaret that is worried about waking the neighbors.
	Understated and underestimated. [Nov 2004, p.113]
	The longer the album runs the more engaging the songs seem to become. [May 2004, p.104]
