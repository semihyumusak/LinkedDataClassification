On a production level, this album is cutting-edge, on a lyrical level it is brutally brilliant. It will melt your ears and your heart.
	Ill Manors, depressing, blunt and provocative, fulfills one of rap music's most noble tasks--to touch the sore spots.
	This is one of the most exhilarating albums of the year.
	Ill Manors is visionary, it's bold, but most importantly it's very good.
	It's a punishing listen certain to prove divisive among his fan base. [Oct 2012, p.95]
	Obviously, hip-hop loves its thugs, too, especially if they're the antiheroes of a relatively nuanced piece like this one.
	Solid, purposeful, and crafted in a manner that betrays both Drew's age and the album's hurried road to release, Ill Manors makes heavy-hitter number three for the rapper, suggesting that Plan B doesn't issue albums, just milestones.
	Drew's work is lyrically dense and confrontational, but the music is blissfully rich and specious. [Sep 2012, p.100]
	After this confrontational opening ditty, Ill Manors becomes less overtly political but no less vivid, as the remaining tracks depict in gruesome detail the dismal lives of London's underclass.
	These songs contain the record's protest element as well as its exemplary musicality: heartbreaking soul choruses, classical samples and '80s rocksteady rhythms.
	A fierce polemic that impresses and frustrates in equal measure.
	It's packed with neat touches.
	Plan B acquits himself remarkably well here.
	Drew's desire to be all things to all 'hoods is the weakness of the soundtrack to his debut movie. [Oct 2012, p.86]
