Young rappers take notice: you want to sound like this when you get older.
	You won't find much in the way of a message on Mic Tyson (closest thing might be on the driving "Pyrex": "wake up, all that crack and the street talk/is made up like Jack & The Beanstalk"), but you will find a raw rap sound seldom heard in these calloused days
	Sean Price has rarely if ever lost a step and Mic Tyson is not going to be the time that he did.
	Price's material-starved fans are craving his words more than beats, so don't call it a comeback but a wicked, wordy return.
	These verses could've fit on any of his past records or mixtapes. But the production on Mic Tyson ties them together nicely.
	It's a matter of execution, and in that regard, fans will have little to complain about.
	Witty, gritty punchlines abound, maintaining the energy level even on those tracks where the beats are somewhat routine. [Feb 2013, p.103]
