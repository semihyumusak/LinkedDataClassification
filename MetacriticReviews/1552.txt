Boasts road-toughened guitars and a welcome accusatory edge. [Aug 2003, p.116]
	So, it's not exactly a musical revolution in the making, but it'll sure be easier to tell her apart from Vanessa Carlton from now on.

	Too often... Branch expresses loneliness or betrayal or yearning without the precision or detail that would make her sentiments memorable. [#17, p.132]
	The album doesn't have the detail of character that made Michelle Branch so appealing the first time out.
	If not as catchy (or stroppy) as Avril Lavigne, she is never less than efficient. [Aug 2003, p.102]

	Most of the songs just lumber along at the same plodding, deliberate pace, boasting very few of the fun hooks that made her previous album so annoyingly likeable.
