After the success of his "six-pack" album concept with Hillbilly Bone, Blake is back to delivering a full-length offering of music.
	Shelton continues to shine as a singer, especially on the heartfelt "I'm Sorry'' and the title track, a tender duet with wife Miranda Lambert.
	At times, Shelton's so charming, he could sing his way down a To Do list.
	Red River Blue, alongside recent efforts by Blake's summer tour-mate Brad Paisley and wife Miranda Lambert, pretty much defines mainstream country these days â€“ high-quality songs, great singing and musicianship, big production, and the same time-honored, predictable six or seven themes that we've all heard before.
	For Shelton's fans, this is a whole helping of what you like best, and it's carefully formulated to be exactly that.
	The album is more scattered in approach, like he's still trying to figure out his best approach to the album format, to his audience, to his genre. In other words, it sounds a lot like country has in general so far this year: comfortable and unfocused.
	Like a lot of good-looking country fellas, perhaps Shelton is better seen and not heard.
	Shelton is the paradigm of the modern Nashville pro.
	Red River Blue may be a significant step forward for Shelton, but he's going to have to be far more consistent in his song choices and steer clear of reductive "I'm so country" shtick like "Good Ole Boys" if he hopes to keep pace with the quality of his wife's albums.
