Lord of the Birdcage is strong and diverse enough to stand out among Pollard's solo efforts, and proves once again this man's talents shine brightest when he finds new ways to challenge himself.
	It's a classic rock 'n' roll expression of general nonconformity and angst which reminds us that the dude sitting on the front porch down the block was a rock star once upon a time.
	While there may not be a ton of surprises from his solo work at this point, this is still an awfully strong set from a guy who's pretty tough to beat when he's on his game.
	Lord Of The Birdcage probably won't be this year's "new" Robert Pollard record for long, but it might very well be the one worth remembering.
	While not on par with essential solo Pollard fare like Not in My Airforce, Waved Out or From a Compound Eye this cohesive, flowing work motors by and, as always, his stirring songs reveal themselves and their riches through repeated listens.
