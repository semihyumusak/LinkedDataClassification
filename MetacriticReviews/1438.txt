Though not every track is a gem, The Dutchess reaches further than most albums by contemporary divas.
	This is one of the most rambunctiously entertaining and high-spirited records of 2006. [Dec 2006, p.108]
	An eclectic, danceable collection of hip-hop, R&B, and pop confections.
	Where the likes of [Gwen] Stefani and co manage to tie eclectic albums together with the strength of their personality, Fergie never actually comes close to showing what she really sounds like, leaving "The Dutchess" as an exceptionally random R&B mixtape.
	A shameless solo debut full of Eighties-style electro bangers.
	Basically, if London Bridge doesn't make you want to rip your ears off, you'll enjoy almost 80 per cent of the album.
	Fergie is talented enough to compete with the likes of Gwen Stefani and Christina Aguilera, but the material on The Dutchess won't take her to those heights.
	Exactly as gratingly infectious as you might expect.
	The problem is the Duchess herself. Fergie exudes earthy charm, but can't keep up with the breakneck music. She forces emotion on the slower show-stoppers, and she's all cartoon kitten on the come-ons. [17 Sep 2006]
	The album too often seems to be striving to display diversity at the expense of artistry.
	She keeps the tone light and playful, but her shopaholic-hottie raps seem written for someone with less emotional baggage. [Nov 2006, p.145]
	When [Fergie] nails it--as she does about half the time on her genre-jumbling solo debut--the result is strange pop that successfully blurs the thin line between annoying and alluring. [Nov 2006, p.160]
	Mildly entertaining but tremendously taxing.
	It’s essentially a Black Eyed Peas album with two fewer rappers. That’s an improvement: two down, two to go. [18 Sep 2006]
	Fergie prances, preens, moans, talks and raps, but the result is canned and sterile.
