Most of Minutes is honed, metallic pop with a hip-hop stride and a wake-up kick.
	There's no great leap into maturity... They've kept their salient feature--scorching, adolescent tantrums--unchanged. [Jun 2007, p.109]
	Whatever else it is, Linkin Park's third studio record is a nu-metal record at heart.
	The music privileges texture over catchiness. [Jun 2007, p.97]
	This is the kind of music artists make to find out who they'll become next: It reaches toward many influences — notably U2 (some songs invoke the Irish rock group almost note-for-note), but also Tool, Evanescence, Nirvana and Coldplay — without committing to anything.

	We've heard a lot of this despair before.
	Amid the stabs at growth, every new effect sounds borrowed.
