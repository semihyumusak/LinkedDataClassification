Even if Diamond Rings' rapidly evolving aesthetic has already moved beyond Special Affections' bedsit R&B, the album still stands as an exemplary model of how one can live out blinged-out fantasies on a cubic zirconia budget.
	Hopefully none of the charm of Special Affections is lost in the process, and the record is seen as more of a building block on which to add, rather than an early turn at which some distance is required. As the former, it is a great start to which greater things are implied, anticipated, and, eventually, expected. No pressure.
	O'Regan's voice is the centerpiece. Unlike seemingly every other bedroom music maker these days, there's a real power and discernable confidence to his croon.
	Pitting his manly baritone against squishy feminine keys in the sexually ambiguous '80s tradition, O'Regan gives his transformation a thrilling edge, not least because there's real danger involved.
	Special Affections is concise and self-assured, which is quite an accomplishment considering O'Regan is still pretty ambiguous and blurry himself.
	Special Affections is both special and affectionate, highly infectious and recommended.
	Much of Special Affections is full of endless, nakedly straightforward laments like, "So I lay on the floor with the heart that I wore upon my sleeve when I lost your love" ("Play By Heart") or "If you want to throw a party, I can cry tonight" ("It's Not My Party"). It pairs well with O'Regan's knack for effortlessly infectious vocal melodies.
