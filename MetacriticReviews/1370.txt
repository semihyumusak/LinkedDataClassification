Pagode will probably be the best love album of the year (and maybe one of the best, period) because Zé has always understood that you can explore feelings without just expressing them.
	Unlike many rockers who cherish childlike ideals only to fall prey to amateurism or whimsy, Ze is aware that kids are both complex in their inventions and earnest in their intentions. [May 2006, p.93]
	No other Brazilian composer defies cultural boundaries so eloquently.
	On a very basic level, this CD is a fun, weird, nifty album of Brazilian pop music, and can easily be enjoyed as such. Unpeel the layers, and you will reap even greeter rewards, revealing a creative treatise on the rights of women in society.
	This is the new definitive rock opera.
	A sprightly psych-pop disc overflowing with exquisite melodies and cooing female voices. [14 Apr 2006, p.86]
	To Ze's credit, the concept never overshadows the songs which, at their heart, are pop songs.
	He forges yet another new vision: one that involves psych rock, quirky funk and bossa nova as much as it does hip-hop and electronica. [#19, p.104]
	In Ze's hands Tropicalia is still a potent, living artistic force. [Jul 2006, p.118]
	Folding in lean funk, tender arias and as many catchy tunes as West Side Story, Ze makes his cryptic polemic perfectly enticing. [Jul 2006, p.105]
	Estudando o Pagode is an impressive album, musically, conceptually, and lyrically, and the cast of musicians and singers Zé assembled delivers on his singular vision.
	"Estudando"... turns mere ideological target practice into surreal and kaleidoscopic musical theater. [9 Apr 2006]
	He's both analytical, distilling songs down to essential parts, and whimsical in his fondness for funny noises. [10 Apr 2006]
	Its dizzying counterpoints, seductive crooning and orgasmic yelps will definitely heat up your next cocktail party.
