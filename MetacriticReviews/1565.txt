The tilting scales of light and dark give the collection a definite creep factor and a clever complexity.
	Oh Land's international debut is an eclectic, nocturnal mix of club music, dance, and electro-pop.
	Oh Land's cinematic arrangements bring Janelle Monáe's ambitious approach to pop music to mind, but tracks like "Wolf & I" and "Lean" draw a bit too heavily from the trip-hop playbook (it doesn't help that Fabricius sounds a lot like Björk) and, however well-excecuted they may be, end up sounding derivative.
	This stunning Dane's synths-plus-strings slant on singer-songwriter lovesickness offers refinement over innovation, yet Nanna Øland Fabricius beguiles with a gently insistent presence.
	It's just that there's a bit of an identity void at the heart of the thing, a lack of personality.
	Oh Land, however, inhabits a tepid middle ground between the two extremes – offering neither gilded Scandi chart-pop (Robyn, Annie) or the artistic mettle of Scandi indie bands, most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway.
	It's lush, detailed, frequently over-rich, but Fabricius' bright, perky voice and some generically kooky lyrics can't really carry the weight of the whole production. [Aug 2011, p.94]
