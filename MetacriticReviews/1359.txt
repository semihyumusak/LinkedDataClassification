May well be the best album of her career.
	Yes, the melodies are a little sillier this time around, however the electro-funk grooves are doubly irresistible.
	The results are ludicrously enjoyable, and somewhere Nile Rodgers is smiling. [13 Feb 2004, p.71]
	Body Language isnt so much a massive artistic leap as it is a total distillation of her sound and style.
	The sexy, solid set is glued together by danceable beats and Minogue's knack for picking great songs and producers.
	Has a slick slutty electroclash vibe. [#9, p.102]
	You cant help but get lost in Minogues music.
	This, basically, is an extremely tastefully done, soulful modern rnb record.
	Kylie Minogue definitely sounds like she has a few more tricks stored on her hard drive than Britney or Christina.
	Body Language finds Kylie partying like it's 1987 all over again, only minus the dubious millinery and Jason Donovan, taking inspiration from the likes of Kool and the Gang and Prince to pleasing if not always memorable effect.
	Still, even though Body Language is a bit of a misstep for Minogue, there's a sense of class to it.
	There is, however, nothing that remotely touches the pop genius of 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' and, by the halfway mark, the album's sagging badly.
	Long stretches prove mysteriously hookless, arid, or burdened by Minogue foregrounding a voice that withers in the glare of the spotlight.
	It's hottest moments are tepid at best. [Feb 2004, p.77]
	For someone so traditionally dancefloor-driven, there are none too many grooves here, and, even for an artist whose most famous lyric may be "la la la", there's not exactly a lot to go on in terms of substance.
	A suite of weak songs and half-finished ideas. [Mar 2004, p.120]
	There's something rote and antiseptic about the album's party mood--the electro-beats' clean squelch, the undercooked hooks, the odd primness of Kylie's singing.
