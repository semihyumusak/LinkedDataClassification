At her best--which must not come easy, or they'd release more and more consistent albums--Rennie Sparks is a great American realist.
	An excellent album.
	An unqualified triumph. [Jun 2006, p.122]
	Although their entire catalog this far is remarkably solid, Last Days of Wonder probably one-ups its predecessors as a consistent band’s most consistent album.
	Songs of weirdness and wonder, set in a half wild, half urban, entirely mysterious place where trees that grow in small squares of dirt hide man-eating boars.
	Last Days Of Wonder is rich in history and nature imagery, yet the couple are equally obsessed with modern life. [Jul 2006, p.101]
	There's such a freshness to Brett Sparks's music that few comparisons can be made. [#269, p.42]
	Last Days of Wonder finds the Handsome Family hitting a comfortable stride.
	If the lyrics weren’t so surreal, you could imagine yourself dining with George and Tammy before a Grand Ole Opry performance.
	The Sparks' performances are so understated, their arrangements so mechanically soothing, that it's easy to miss Rennie's brutal, elegant twists on folk cliches. [Jul 2006, p.99]
	The layered caramel of [Brett's] voice stays thick from track to track, but finally, it's Rennie's poetry that gives Last Days Of Wonder its legs.
	Transcend[s] the alt-country tag. [Aug 2006, p.206]
	It's still better than most of the records that have come out this year; it's just that the Sparks family has set such a high precedent that even slight missteps are bound to disappoint.
	What's new is the sense of glory that pervades the madness. [Aug 2006, p.94]
	An uneven album that unfortunately contains several such missed opportunities.
	One can't help but think that just a little bit more spice might have elevated all of these beautiful ideas out of the trappings of their now painfully insular song structures.
	It's easy enough to listen to the album as a whole, but roughly a third of the songs are clunkers.
