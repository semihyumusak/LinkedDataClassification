He stamps tunes ranging from Culture Club's "Do You Really Want To Hurt Me" to Phil Ochs' "Rehearsals for Retirement" with his sad-sack aesthetic--to chilling effect. [17 May 2002, p.78]
	The perfect vehicle for Eitzel's gorgeous, weary voice and wry, savage humour. [June 2002, p.106]
	Most of its 10 tracks are quiet and winsomely melancholy--Eitzel's dominant mode of expression--and the titular "courage and confidence" has more to do with the pleasure of a singer-songwriter successfully submerging himself in someone else's song.
	Eitzel makes the songs his own, re-working them with a degree of affection and passion usually lacking from the covers-album genre. [Jul 2002, p.104]
	A charming enough document that fans will almost certainly find worthwhile.
	While he's a better songwriter than a singer, Eitzel definitely knows his way around a tune. [Jun 2002, p.82]
	Music, while a pleasant listen, is nowhere near the heartfelt art Eitzel normally blesses us with. [#54, p.86]
	It takes a few listens for Songs to feel more than just odd, but as with most Eitzel projects, its mood lingers like cigar smoke. [Jun/Jul 2002, p.106]
	Lacking the startling mark of cool-hearted covermongers such as Cat Power and Mark Kozelek, this is still an easeful album of mostly slow-blooded tunes.
	As the program continues, it becomes clear that he has reinvented most of the tracks in pretty much the same way, and the limits of his low-key, almost whispery vocals can grow tiring.
	Practically drips with misery. [June 2002, p.112]
	Begins as a curious listen and ends up just being a drag.
	Courage and Confidence exhibits practically all of the possible flaws of cover records, and virtually none of the potential pluses.
