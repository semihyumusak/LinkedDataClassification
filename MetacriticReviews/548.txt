Shyne's Tupac-esque reflections on honor and mortality are penetrating, and suggest there are greater meditations yet to be unleashed. [20/27 Aug 2004, p.126]
	Godfather Buried Alive is a worthy listen, showcasing Shyne's unfiltered honesty in its uncompromising form.
	While the J-Kwons and Juveniles enjoy the fruits of paradise and their Lexus helicopters, Shyne reminds us of the ones who didn't make it: the legions of his fellow Clinton inmates fighting to keep afloat under prison's psychic burden.
	An uneven affair. [15 Aug 2004]
	Godfather doesn't sound dated; it sounds dateless, in a bad sense--boilerplate raps and beats that could have been recorded whenever and wherever. [16 Sep 2004, p.78]
	The beats may be basic and the quality fuzzy... but there are diamonds among the dirt. [21 Aug 2004, p.49]
	Many beats... sound cheap, and many rhymes... trade drama for tough-guy same-old. [Oct 2004, p.128]
	Patchy... Little of his indignant bluster hits the mark. [Oct 2004, p.130]
	The majority of the album is just not very interesting.
