	For all its maximalist glory, DISCO is remarkably nuanced, minor elements seamlessly shifting in and out of frame behind the compositions’ vibrant foregrounds.
	Totally cohesive and thoroughly bangin’.
	Never merely meager, this project delivers, both when you're waving your orgy-snorkel all blotto on-the-town, and for a soundtrack to serious rumination at your midday desk of harsh reality.
	HEALTH’s brand of joy is a sinister one, and HEALTH//DISCO brings that to the forefront in all its wild-eyed glory.
	A facinating treatment, and really rather groovy. [Sep 2008, p.89]
	This cohesive, up-tempo, synth-heavy series of interpretations manages to mirror the original's diversity of approach. [Summer 2008, p.94]
	Undoubtedly it's a very effective dance record, and in a club everything here would sound great. As an album, though, HEALTH//DISCO is encumbered by the very tracks that have birthed it.
