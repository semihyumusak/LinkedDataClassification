Outta Sight/Outta Mind is not an album that you can discuss in measured tones whilst tending to your beard. It is an album that will only cause mass hysteria and blood clots and burst forth Kundalini from the base of your spine like some auto-massage chair plugged into the wrong transformer while you holler wheeeeaaauurgh!! and finally slump down into a wet pile of exhaustion.
	They are still greasy rock & rollers who know how to keep a party going. [Oct 2004, p.120]
	A less full-tilt affair than their first effort... but no less fun. [Jul 2004, p.95]
	A denim-clad, riff-heavy beast of a rock album. [Amazon UK]
	Halfway through... it becomes a directionless mess. [Jul 2004, p.113]
	Much of the time they sound like a 1973 youth club rock band.
	Their preoccupation with '70s British metal finds them wandering dangerously into gobilin-and-ghouls prog-rock territory. [5 Jun 2004, p.54]
	Amount[s] to little more than a facsimile of their forefathers. [Nov 2004, p.149]
	They seem like a garden-variety hard rock band, one that would have been generic and forgettable in 1974, and one that is generic and forgettable in 2004.
	Part of me likes that the Datsuns are 100% serious about doing their own thing, regardless of what the scene demands, but when their "thing" amounts to a heap of riffs leftover from the Carter administration, I can't get that excited.
	Their caveman take on 70s nostalgia-- simultaneously misguided and entirely too obvious-- renders them mostly forgettable and entirely ineffectual.
	For people awaiting that second Jet album, this should prove a welcome distraction from their crayons. For the rest of us it's a look of bemusement and a scratched head.
	As recently as last year it looked like The Datsuns might be next in line to make arena-sized, super-popular rock the way Zeppelin, AC/DC and G'n'R did. They still might, but it's going to take better songs than these.
	[The Datsuns] now sound unfit to carry the Donnas' jockstraps. [Oct 2004, p.120]
