Is it an improbably good second album? Looks like it.
	It’s a pleasant mess, it’s well-meaning, and there’s enough pop here to satisfy the band’s fans.
	The songs sizzle merrily, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts, and the relentlessness becomes wearing. [Oct 2008, p.139]
	The album aims for Grohl-esque rock anthems, but falls short mostly due to a lack of melodic gifts; given that, it needs many more musical ideas than it has to keep anybody interested.
	More shouty rock and party anthems from the valleys.
	Elsewhere, the Welsh four-piece are merely witless. Utterly awful.
