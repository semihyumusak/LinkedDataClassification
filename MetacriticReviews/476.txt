Despite a few stumbles, Identified achieves its goal: it anticipates that Hudgens' fans will outgrow "High School Musical" soon enough, and gives her a better chance of staying relevant to them as they move on to other kinds of pop music.
	The rest of Identified, though, panders to the preteen demo with stop-start pop that ranges from pleasant (the title track) to dull ("Amazed") to off-putting ("Hook It Up"). But for little girls, this is one nonstop singalong.
	Her voice was made to rip, and when she lets go just a little, the coyness turns sultry--proof that she might just have a life after high school.
	As a placeholder for Hudgens' future career, Identified serves its purpose, even if it's seldom identifiable as her own work.
	Itâ€™s schizoid, but it routinely succeeds, very much in spite of itself.
	Hudgens hews to the Disney content code, only occasionally tiptoeing into double-entendre. Hudgens can't really sing, so her producers handle the heavy lifting.
	Right now, this High Schooler's musical graduation is stalling somewhere around sophomoric.
