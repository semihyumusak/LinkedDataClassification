American Tragedy is wildly fun, a head-thumping, booze-chugging, 14 track-long hedonistic binge.
	American Tragedy is a tight mash-up between contemporary sonics and old-school aesthetic.
	Some of the more rap-heavy moments are terrible, but when they throw in huge, guitar-laden choruses such as on Been To Hell and Hear Me Now, they hit the same anthemic heights as Linkin Park. [2 Apr 2011, p.51]
	The downside is that along with heart and brains, Hollywood Undead has filtered out any sense of humor from its music, which makes American Tragedy virtually impossible to listen to for longer than a few songs at a time.
	The crew is still intentionally misogynistic and profane, sounding like caricatures of Eminem or Kid Rock as they rap and sing about gangsta cliches like puffing blunts, drinking Patron, getting booty, and "flossing."
	Hollywood Undead are content to deliver cliches--more out of a lack of imagination than cynical opportunism, but it still smacks of both. That's why to seasoned ears or any genre fan requiring more than more of the same, they're very, very boring.
