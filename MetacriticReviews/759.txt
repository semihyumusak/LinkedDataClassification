This is one of the albums of the year: completely out of left field and completely solid from start to finish.
	I cant recommend this album strongly enough.
	One of the most surprising, challenging, and important albums of the year.
	Suffice to say, Menomena are a hugely creative band, and with I Am the Fun Blame Monster, they've managed to make an album that's extremely accessible yet entirely unconventional.
	I Am the Fun Blame Monster is totally vibrant, totally groovy, and once again, totally awesome.
	They sound like no one else.
	While it makes no effort to conceal its intellect, it solicits an under-the-table emotional connection the Seas and Cakes of the indiesphere simply will not allow.
	It will take at least ten listens before you hear everything thats going on, and ten more to understand it, yet this is far from impenetrable; it boasts a melody line that any pop princess would sell her plastic soul for, and prompts the idea that Knopf and his cohorts have been hanging around a crossroads doing just the same.
	While the production techniques are so ingenious as to occasionally outshine the melodic content of the songs themselves, these are first and foremost pop songs. [#8, p.115]
	For a debut, it's a remarkabley inventive and interesting release.
	A promising debut from a band more clever than it is musically accomplished.
	Menomena clearly thinks of itself as a clever bunch of musicians. Maybe next time around they'll be more interested in sharing their wit with their listeners rather than just alluding to it.
	Menomena is a wickedly creative band.
	One of the most original-sounding albums in a long while.
