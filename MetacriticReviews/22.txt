With placid, feline production, tight harmonies and breezy beats, much of DNA ambles along the well-trodden path of the temperate demi-ballad. But it's the ventures away from this that prove Little Mix function far better either side of mid-tempo.
	A solidly enjoyable, radio-ready pop album.
	When off-kilter beats collide with impeccable harmonies and pleasingly daft lyrics, it sounds like pop as it should be, and their gamble in borrowing De La Soul's Ring Ring Ring refrain for How Ya Doin comes good. The ballads, however, plod along with heavy-handed emotion.
	Such an efficient compendium of current pop influences is a little underwhelmng; nothing here sets out to redefine the girl group sound.
	The main duty of pop is to be catchy, and it's a duty which DNA mostly shirks miserably.
