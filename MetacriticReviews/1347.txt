G-Unit fans and Lloyd Banks fans in particular will be satisfied with "Rotten Apple."
	Banks seems determined to launch a one-man revival with perfectly polished tracks like "Addicted" and "Hands Up."
	A unifying moodiness holds the album together and succeeds in defining a regional New York City sound.
	[It] works best when he's rapping alongside guests.
	It runs a little thin over sixteen tracks.
	The highlights are way high, but the album as a whole is "fans-only."
	Trademark G-Unit, pakced with a few thunderous club jams and too little else. [Oct 2006, p.128]
	Clever turns of phrase, the reason you go to Banks in the first place, are in lesser supply on Apple, replaced with boilerplate declarations of supremacy. [Oct 2006, p.148]
	Rotten Apple... doesn’t try to address Banks’ shortcomings, it just buries them under tectonic plates of NYC sturm und drang and more of Banks guffawing end rhymes.
	G-Unit needs to stop remaking Lloyd Banks's first hit, On Fire, from, like, two years ago.
	Where “The Hunger for More” was sly and (almost despite itself) infectious, this rather workmanlike CD isn’t so memorable. [9 Oct 2006]
	For a gangster, Banks sure plays it safe.
	As tedious as an episode of Teletubbies--and nearly as simplistic. [13 Oct 2006, p.131]
	Even Banks' better-than-average skills can't save "Rotten Apple" from mediocrity.
