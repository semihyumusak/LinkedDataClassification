	The Devil's Rain feels like a 50/50 shot-in-the-dark project, starting in a place unsure of its own existence and finishing strong with the uncompromising "Death Ray."
	The Devil's Rain, then, is a slightly mixed bag of tricks, treats and travesties.
	The Devil's Rain is chock full of good, campy horror business.
	In the end, then, it's not that The Devil's Rain is a bad album, but it's by far the weakest link in the band's catalog, and coming at a time when faith in the group is at an all-time low.
