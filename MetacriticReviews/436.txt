Try not to grin inanely as the banjo-led big band play "The Bare Necessities," sob to Wilson's lounge lizard harmonies on "When You Wish Upon A Star" or find lions sexy during his restrained "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"
	Despite the natural feel of these songs as sung by Wilson and performed by his talented backing band, anyone who's paid attention to his solo career of the '90s and 2000s won't hear any surprises.
	In Mickey Mouse terms, this album is more the blandly suburban color Mickey than the anarchic black-and-white Mickey. The shape is the same; the spirit isn't.
	Mostly, the album suffers from just too much of the patronizing, saccharine Disney vibe and not enough echt Wilson.
