Much like the performance that has forever etched the band into my brain, this LP has a whole lot of showmanship and theatricality, but under the surface it's a refreshing take on the post-punk movement.
	Once you strip away all this nonsense, The Chapman Family's music is thunderous and well produced.
	Burn Your Town makes a refreshing change from your average debut indie LP for a couple of primary reasons. Firstly, it's showcasing a band who, rather than going down the easy route, actually care a lot more about first impressions than most of their contemporaries. Secondly, it hints that they could grow and mature nicely.
	They're not so much fiddling while Rome burns as clattering bass and drums magnificently while they take a torch to Redcar.
	Too late for success, maybe, but identity crisis (narrowly) avoided. [Apr 2011, p.84]
	With a little more focus and a little less self-doubt, The Chapman Family's second record should easily surpass this still pleasing statement of future intent. Just so long as they don't take too much time recording it.
	The admirable rhetoric might mean something were it not backed by such a generic pastiche of Editors/White Lies/Interpol, all cavernous bass and drums and two-note guitar solos. [Apr 2011, p.98]
