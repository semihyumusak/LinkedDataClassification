With tracks like "15 Minutes" to slow things down for those romantic moments, and an upbeat song such as "All Said And Done" to keep things moving along at a decent pace, Jamie Foxx's LP is a pleasant addition to the current R&B landscape.
	It's good that Mr. Timberlake doesn't operate at full throttle, because this album's successes often come in spite of Mr. Foxx, who sings as if he were delivering lines for the camera: declarative, extra literal, sharp at the edges.
	The Oscar-winning actor musters little of his usual charisma here, especially in crowded hip-hop tracks such as ''Yep Dat's Me,'' which Ludacris steals like a cartoon villain. Foxx fares better in the sleek R&B stuff.
	Weirdly, Best evokes the early career of Rihanna, where a just-OK voice perfectly nestles into the steely production around it.
	The success of a record like this is pretty easy to track on a utilitarian level: After listening you either want to party with the dude or you don't.
	Highlights are pushed to the front, so consider the last four songs or so bonus tracks. You'll still be left with a substantial good time.
	It's refreshing to hear him finally switch up his script.
	He drops his share of deafening clunkers, poisoning some songs so badly that they become unlistenable. But others, mostly those where he stands back and croons harmlessly in the background, are deliciously chill.
	Fake ass love-making music was dead in the mid-'90s, let alone the talentless urban landscape of 2010.
