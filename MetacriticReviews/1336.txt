[Jurado] may be our generation's Neil Young. [Apr 2003, p.78]
	While the comparisons to Springsteen's Nebraska and Gillian Welch's Time (The Revelator) are obvious, they don't do justice to Jurado's wholly original craft. [Jun 2003, p.98]
	Not for the faint-hearted, Damien Jurado is a habit which won't necessarily bring joy to the listener. But once acquired, you will find it hard to kick. [Apr 2003, p.106]
	Jurado's spare, edgy songs are miniature masterpieces of mood and character. [#229, p.68]
	There's a core of strength running through this darkly unobtrusive music which lends it a coherence of vision, drawing as it does on place and character as it roams the less fashionable byways of an older America, hitching the frayed strands of the past to the lurching wagon of the present.
	Easily Jurado's most successful album, both musically and lyrically.
	A small triumph, but a triumph nonetheless.
	Less, in this case, proves to be much more; Jurado's songs just cut closer when unadorned. [#58, p.95]
	His most rewarding and assured work yet.
	The sparse and largely unobtrusive music, and Juradoâ€™s wanting vocal range place the emphasis on storytelling, one his strongest assets. The results, however, are a mixed bag.
	Jurado's songwriting is solid, if sometimes slightly bland -- but a lack of idiosyncrasy is to be expected when an artist references such a recognizable, well-mined sound.
	Where Shall You Take Me? brings Jurado back to familiar, minimalist territory.
