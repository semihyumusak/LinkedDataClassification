It's the product of two remarkable artists working in perfect unison, powered by an effortless chemistry that recalls similarly blessed collaborations between Madlib and MF Doom, or MF Doom and Danger Mouse.
	More than a few productions provide the type of slick, West Coast grind that allows Aceyalone to play the Lothario but still sound like he's satirizing the lover-man archetype.
	Aceyalone can't do it by himself, and by finding a kindred musical spirit in RJD2, he manages to make an album as expansive as his talent continually hints at.
	Refined attention to detail gives Magnificent City the kind of structural awareness that distinguishes exceptional records from merely great ones.
	This is not RJD2's best work, but this record contains several stunning creations and very few disappointments. Aceyalone settles for too little, allowing his natural skill to carry him in the absence of true purpose, but his voice still weaves deftly throughout most of the album.
	If Magnificent City is occasionally over-friendly-sounding... well, so what? [Mar 2006, p.138]
	A unified effort from these two proven hip-hop vets. [Feb/Mar 2006, p.96]
	Aceyalone's deft merging of bookishness and braggadocio is a rare find. [17 Feb 2006, p.79]
	When RJ sticks to the bounce aesthetic and Acey keeps his writing lucid and/or topical, the record becomes the most listenable of the emcee's recent output.
	Magnificent City is lazy and inept, devoid of force and inspiration and chemistry.
