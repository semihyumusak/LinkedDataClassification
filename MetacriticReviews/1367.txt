Her Space Holiday is a satisfying conclusion.
	Her Space Holiday brings together all the key elements of Bianchi's decade-and-a-half of coloring outside the lines of the pop infrastructure to deliver a swan song appropriately fitting for his underrated one-man-act.
	The self-titled conclusion serves as a gentle, appropriate valediction.
	Despite the plethora of guest artists and novel sounds, Her Space Holiday reveals the growing pains of Bianchi evolving his breathy, depressive lyrics and minimalist synthetic touches into something more uplifting.
	Like XOXO, HSH is consistent, just not consistently good.
	Most of the songs here aren't even good enough to be considered for a knockoff commercial targeted at the "indie-inclined" twenty-something demographic.
