All 10 songs on the album include strings, including the arena-ready 'Air Traffic Control' and the nine-minute 'Hopesick.' Whether these changes represent an improvement for Louis XIV is debatable--mostly it is hit and miss. [Winter 2008, p.83]
	Here they effectively marry T. Rex's trash-glam melodicism to a relentless blue-eyed funk beat. [Feb 2008, p.95]
	The moments of rocked-out swagger are fleeting and ultimately drowned out by a musical and lyrical heaviness that turns the album into a real downer.
	The San Diego rockers haven’t completely reined in their runaway libidos on Slick Dogs and Ponies, but they stray from the devilish attitude that made their brazen dirty talk such a riot.
	There's still too much of Brian Karscig's ultracampy 'Big Balls'--style vocals, and it sometimes feels like these guys have confused expanding their range with finding new sources to rip off.
	Sick Dogs never coalesces into anything more than the sum of its noisy, jagged parts.
	Aside from a handful of tunes, little here is all that memorable, namely because the hooks can’t see their way clear of the repetitive, robotic arrangements.
	Louis XIV has a considerable amount of work to do for listeners to regard them as more than aimless glam-rock fetishists.
	The slightly more dynamic Louis XIV only give you testosterone-fueled rock at its least appealing extremes: heedless lust or, arguably even more repulsive, cheesy balladry.
	Though more adventurous than 2005's "The Best Little Secrets Are Kept," the band's sophomore LP, Slick Dogs and Ponies, still rings soulless at its core.
