The eighth Marilyn Manson album features some of his finest lyrics yet and, musically, it often approaches the heyday of Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals.
	"Born Villain" finds a seemingly refreshed and clear-minded Manson and his band poring through a diverse set of moods and styles in songs that cut a little deeper than the deliberate provocation of many of his previous works.
	Like fine steak, Born Villain is at its best raw and bloody.
	All told, Born Villain is as valiant and exciting an effort as the group has come up with in years.
	Perhaps it's too monochrome, too arty. [28 Apr 2012, p.52]
	The truth is, though, there's just a lack of magic, a lack of something special going on. It's not bad. It's not good.
	Subject matter such as the aforementioned romanticism is refreshing, and maybe that will be pushed to the foreground in future records, but it only appears in spurts on Born Villain.
	The sound of a middle-aged shock rocker long past his creative, controversial, and commercial peak trying to drag his the ball-and-chain of his career along as he trudges over the hill. Sadly, it's all rather predictable.
	This record has been hailed by some as a return to form, but it's every inch as pointless as his last couple of records and a contender for dullest album of the year.
	If he tried to find something he liked, he might actually make something worth listening to.
