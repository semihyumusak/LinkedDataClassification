Leave It All Behind is a concise and complete set of songs that brings out the best of both producer Nicolay and Phonte.
	This talented duo has made one hell of an album, actually one of the best of 2008, in the process.
	With electronic and live sounds, emotional production and excellent vocals from some of the underground sceneâ€™s best, Leave It All Behind is an open and experimental take on hip-hop and soul, highly successful, at that.
	Musically, Nicolay's in his comfort zone, making the sort of album he'd been more or less heading towards since "Connected," an album that, while certainly rooted in hip-hop, knocked like a pillow fight.
	Nicolay has never been afraid to go soft and smooth, but his production on Leave It sometimes borders on easy listening.
