The Sadies' best album yet.
	A seamless, melodic blend of psychedelia and C&W... the songs and instrumentals here hang together beautifully. [Nov 2004, p.95]
	Imagine a troupe of gloomy cow-punks careening down a thundering Hawaiian pipeline and you've got a bead on their wildly divergent sound.
	There's an emerging depth and pensiveness to their songwriting, a growing sense of spirituality and drama.
	Hones the Southern harmonies and guitar-pickin' crosstalk of the brothers Good. [Nov 2004, p.116]
	Favourite Colours is lovely and adventurous stuff that proves the Sadies are only getting better with each trip into the studio.
	They can still write the most incredibly beautiful songs. [23 Oct 2004, p.49]
	The results [on previous albums] came off a little mannered, but on Favourite Colours, the band finally exhibits an integrated command of its genre obsessions, playing chilly-but-urgent music with a distinctly Sadies flavor.
	But while the album is stylistically and sonically brilliant, it still suffers from the primary flaw of the band's four previous albums: Their songwriting hasn't made the same leap as their chops.
