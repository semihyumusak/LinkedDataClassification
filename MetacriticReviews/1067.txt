In emulating great vocalists he has admired, from Jeff Buckley to Judy Garland, the guitarist conjures a serene lyricism. Female vocalists drawn from the worlds of opera (Olivia Safe), swing (Imelda May) and soul (Joss Stone) provide window-dressing, and the symphony orchestra accompaniment is gratuitous.
	Beck has chosen to forgo his signature frenzied fretboard blitzkriegs and weave long, laconic phrases, his guitar rich, thick, and warm, sounding familiar yet different: he's never sustained this level of grace for a full record, and his soulful playing cuts through the clean sheen of the production, always commanding attention even when he's not demanding it.
	Though the individual songs are quite different stylistically, it's an incredibly cohesive album, with the tracks flowing together and melding effortlessly into a beautiful expression of Jeff Beck's exploratory impulse.
	Emotion & Commotion embraces tunes so big you'd think no more could be wrung into them. [May 2010, p. 93]
	Imagine Phil Mickelson in a round of putt-putt and you'll get a sense of what's on the line for Beck's first studio album in seven years.
	The guitar legend ticks that box [soporific Muzak] here with laid back instrumental versions of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" and "Nessun Dorma" that recreates the excitement of an elevator ride. [14 Apr 2010, p.73]
	Yes, Beck was always unpredictable, but this is one weirdly unfocused album. [May 2010, p.83]
	His first studio album in sedven years is an indigestible hotchpotch containing everything from heavier-than-thou riffing to ill-judged tilt at Puccini's Nessun Dorma. [May 2010, p.126]
