Lewis and Staind sound as though they have emerged from a long, dark tunnel, and that kind of progress is more than just an illusion.
	Most of all, the music packs as much punch as ever--and more variety, as Staind sometimes departs from its rock-metal power ballads for tunes that suggest Pink Floyd and even Brit band Oasis in the chiming-guitar pop of 'All I Want.'
	The title of Staind's sixth album is a bit of a misnomer, but there are a few new stylistic directions here.
	Ballads have always been his forte, a convenient vehicle for his quivering sensitivity and accidental melodicism, yet it's still startling how slow The Illusion of Progress unfolds, as Staind rarely muster the energy to move beyond midtempo even when they deign to crank up their amps for anthems of mild alienation or vague inspiration.
	Most of the time, though, the band sticks to its comfort zone, with songs that proceed through a sequence of genre clich√©s as Lewis howls out woe-is-me's and lists of grievances.
	One formula replaces another and another.
	This solid--if unspectacular--sixth managed a very respectable Number 3 (on the Billboard charts). [Nov 2008, p.107]
	Their sixth album is an unlovely cocktail of faux-Cobain grunting, downtuned guitars and self-pity. [Nov 2008, p.119]
