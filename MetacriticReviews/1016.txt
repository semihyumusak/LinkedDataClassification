The whole thing tingles: you're in the presence of diamond-hard greatness. [Nov 2004, p.110]
	The songwriting has their old ebullience and craftiness. [9 Apr 2004, p.86]
	The Sunday girl may be entering her autumn years, but shes still an absolute treasure.
	Dub, metal, Okinawan folk, hip-hop and various strains of out jazz all inflect Blondies hooky popcraft, and they never pretend theyre something theyre not, such as young.
	A saucy strut of an album that may not measure up to the classics but wipes the floor with imitators like Madonna.
	A mostly solid collection of quirky dance pop and cryptic rock.
	The album is engagingly eclectic, always melodic, sometimes hard and storming, but never quite so sublime [as single "Good Boys"]. [Nov 2004, p.132]
	That isn't to say that The Curse of Blondie is a classic Blondie disc, but it's the first good one since at least Autoamerican, and features one of their best-ever singles in "Good Boys."
	A decidedly inconsistent effort.
	It's a valiant effort to try something new, or at least try some new old styles, but the real curse of The Curse Of Blondie is that it only occasionally approaches past greatness.
	There's not quite enough to justify the addition of another album to the Blondie catalogue.
	Too much of The Curse would be blandly anonymous if not for Harry's inimitable coo.
	The group has obviously lost whatever touch they once had for making unique, interesting music.
