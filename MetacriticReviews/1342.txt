An ambient record that doesn't bore or get bogged down in its insistence on fading into the background.
	Steingarten is a nearly perfect album.
	Betke hasn’t merely licked his wounds and retreated into familiar territory, but fused some lessons learned from his own back catalog to create a shiny new beast, at once identifiable as his work and yet something tangibly different.
	Instead of hip-hop, Betke now appears inspired by the hypnotic riddims of Krautrock and the New York art-dance scene of the 1970s. [May 2007, p.97]
	Electronic music is seldom this engaging or characterful. [Apr 2007, p.121]
	Steingarten combines clipped, Kompakt-style 4/4 funk with a massy dub sensibility reminiscent of Adrian Sherwood's Tackhead productions. [Apr 2007, p.114]
	For what it is, it’s just about perfect.
	Pole’s technique still relies heavily on the minimal, but Steingarten is garnished with a sonic density lacking on his first three full-lengths.
	It all makes for a captivating listen or a dreamy forty minutes, whatever your preference - though a possible failing can be found in only occasional glimpses of the human soul.
	Steingarten is a unique take on ambient/glitch inspired music however it’s lack of musical progression brings it down.
