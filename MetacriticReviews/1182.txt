It's got breezy lounge fare, vocoder-driven club cuts, and a joyful average-Joe appeal long gone from the fracturing world of DJ music. [10 Feb 2006, p.137]
	There isn't much in here that could be considered hip, or that shows technical skill. But there's a total gut-level joy, as if these were tracks made by an ecstatic, well-meaning kid who hadn't yet encountered the complicated concerns of the places people might actually dance to them.
	Each song is perfectly buoyant and bold standing alone or considered on the whole. [Jan/Feb 2006, p.95]
	Every bit as compelling as contemporaneous efforts from likeminded electronic artists Daft Punk, Lemon Jelly, and the Orb.
	Filling the gaps between Prince and !!!, this is for those who spent the last two decades shaking their hips rather than banging their heads.
	'Destroy Rock & Roll' is exponentially more than the sum of its parts.
	On Destroy Rock & Roll, Mylo hasn’t made the crossover hit of, say, You’ve Come a Long Way, Baby; and at the same time, Mylo’s less inventive, and therefore requires less of his listeners than an act like Basement Jaxx or Felix da Housecat. But that’s fine.
	Impressively, all this is delivered with sufficient panache to make it sound fresh and exciting, rather than merely eager to please. [Jun 2004, p.105]
	What you should go to Destroy Rock and Roll for is highly enjoyable, competent, reasonably inventive, energetic techno.
	Though far from groundbreaking, "Destroy Rock & Roll" spotlights an artist who has a knack for cleverly referencing music that has come before. [11 Feb 2006]
	The only minus: The spoken bits that initially animate several tracks soon grow tedious.
	Hard not to admire his audacity as much as his ear for a great drivetime radio riff.
	For all the bravado of its title, Destroy Rock & Roll is in fact a neat, listenable trip.
	Simple beats and waves of synthesized strings don't, in themselves, make for neo-disco euphoria.
