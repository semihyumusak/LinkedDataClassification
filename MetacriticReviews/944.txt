Dangerous Magical Noise is rock and roll at its pure, shaggy best. If you're tired of that, you're tired of life.
	Collins's way with a hook has blown up into a stack of tunes that stick, ranging from cranked-up faux-arena rock to spine-shaking rhythm and staccato bounce.
	Stubbornly lo-fi and expectedly scrappy, the album is also tremendously listenable, a rhythmic, leg-flailing romp through vintage soul cool, glam boogie, classic rock thrash, and punk bravado.
	Its a glorious low-frequency hootenanny that slurs soul, punk, psych-rock, and pop until youre not sure what language youre hearing anymore.
	Dangerous, magical, and gleefully noisy. [Dec 2003, p.113]
	Tunes like "Sun is Shining" and "Stop" highlight Collins' surprisingly soulful voice and separate Dangerous ... from the innumerable garage albums released weekly.
	Dangerous Magical Noise is a great Friday night, and your ears will ring through Sunday. [Nov 2003, p.112]
	The Dirtbombs are a rock & roll band pure and simple, and if you like pure and simple rock & roll with a dash of soul, you will flip over Dangerous Magical Noise.
	They are clearly a band of great musical knowledge and breadth, yet manage to avoid coming off as pale pastiches of other great bands. [#5, p.100]
	A stoned gas. [Dec 2003, p.123]
	Hit or miss. [Dec 2003, p.154]
	The fact this collection of originals is inferior to 2001's Ultraglide In Black (a covers album) reveals [Mick Collins'] songwriting has never matched his energy. [Nov 2003, p.118]
