Nelly and Akon do a reasonable job of making 'Body On Me' sound almost like a single, but it's not enough to change the fact that what could well be the best album of Ashanti's career is almost certain to be her most overlooked.
	Bottom line, this is neither a great nor a poor Ashanti album. It's decent, just like the rest of them.
	On the synthy, Darkchild-produced 'So Over You,' Ashanti croons about getting past a former relationship, while the Jermaine Dupri-mixed 'Good Good,' featuring elements of Michael Jackson's 'The Girl Is Mine,' finds her confidently belting about her abilities to please in bed.
	The Declaration simply doesn't make much of a statement, and its high point isn't enough to unseat the Beyonces and Mary J.'s of the world. [20 June 2008, p.66]
	Past releases have displayed an ostensible desire to follow in the melodramatic steps of Mary J. Blige and much of Declaration continues in that quest.
	But even with all the emo-passion, nearly half of this album is lukewarm.
	Sleek but insubstantial fourth outing from R&B songstress.
	Ashanti’s still got a decent voice, but she’s badly in need of a better songwriting and production team.
	On her fourth album, she's still doing the diva-by-numbers thing, alternating between angry-at-her-man anthems and lovey pleasantry.
	After four years away, Ashanti declares that she's back, but this middling, familiar set of songs is unlikely to reclaim her spotlight.
	This is too timid for modern R&B, too bland to rival Blige, and won't halt the sharp decline since 2003's "Rock Wit U." [Sep 2008, p.110]
