It's the beautifully austere, grown-up pop album we've been waiting years for Mac McCaughan to record. [Jun 2003, p.97]
	It stands as not only the most fully realized Portastatic album but as one that ought not be overshadowed by its creator's more well-known outlet. [#59, p.107]
	Accomplished, varied, and rather easygoing, though not gripping, indie pop/rock.
	A dozen simple, beautiful dirges. [May 2003, p.108]
	Though it may not quite reach the peaks of 1997's The Nature of Sap, its polish and expert production make it Portastatic's most diverse and accomplished work to date.
	Even the tracks that don't quite work don't miss the mark by much, and while there's nothing too flashy going on within, the solid overall quality of the 12 tracks and 50 minutes of music is somewhat of a rarity.
	It sounds like heÂ’s cherry-picked his record collection in an attempt to allow the listener a glimpse into his restless mind.
	The banality here neutralizes the complexity and thoughtfulness one finds elsewhere on this record, giving the false sense that the whole thing is more saccharine than it really is. Sadly, that's what happens when the good songs are as forgettable as the bad.
	An uneven mish-mash of musical ideas that is only occasionally thrilling.
