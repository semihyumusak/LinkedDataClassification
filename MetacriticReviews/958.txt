	This is a Joy Division/New Order-worshipping surprise that should have you dancing or nodding your head should it go near your club or iPod. [Winter 2009, p.79]
	Techno-oriented tracks like “Fire” and “Divebomb, while serviceable forays into the genre, sound out of place and disrupt the lilting momentum of the record. However, these slight missteps are are not enough to ruin a solid first effort from a band that is an undoubtedly promising addition to the dance-rock canon.
	While opener 'Trash' sounds like the sort of thing Bloc Party should have done after "Silent Alarm," most tracks are hurt by a real lack of lyrical depth.
	In the final analysis, The Whip need to focus more on the dynamics of the dance floor and less on looking cool for the covers of inkies.
	Sadly, nothing else on the Whip's debut matches that electrifying outburst, as the Manchester, England quartet downshift into a less savage, more sensitive sound often verging on generic synth pop.
	The lack of personality running through all these tracks suggest a band not actually chomping at the bit.
