Simply awesome.
	An album that sets the bar for density and imagination almost unreasonably high.
	The richest and most fervent music the Jaxx have ever made. [24 Oct 2003, p.104]
	Some of the most propulsive, ferocious music of the year as well as some of the most poignant.
	A truly exhilarating 50 minutes of music. [Dec 2003, p.122]
	Three albums in and Basement Jaxx are still so far ahead of the pack that they're a barely visible dust cloud on the horizon.
	Kish Kash may be the best dance record of 2003, but it's the least imaginative LP the duo have ever released.
	Quite how or where the new album fits into the contemporary music landscape isn't clear, but what's recognizable and of import is that somewhat out of time, Basement Jaxx have produced their best sustained effort so far.
	A funky good time from two house music smarty pants with a future.
	A downbeat, surprisingly ruminative affair, less concerned with dance-floor breakouts than the inevitable post-party comedown.
	Review 1:Kish Kash suffers from a surfeit of ideas and sounds; quite simply there is too much going on here. [score=70] Review 2:It is simply how dance music--natch, pop music--should be done.  [score=90]
	Most of Kish Kash sounds like the album they intended to make after Remedy. [Nov 2003, p.106]
	It's not stretching to suggest that they've complicated house music's ease so effectively that Kish Kash often resembles, well, postpunk.
	As far as style and technique go, it's more of the same; quite literally MORE. 'Kish-Kash'? Mish-mash: Basement Jaxx make dancefloor monsters, Frankenstein's monster stylee.
	Their most violently inventive album yet. [Nov 2003, p.109]
	The energy never sags and ideas never flag.
	A kaleidoscopic dance record that borrows a bit from Remedy and Rooty but... has a labyrinthine identity all its own. [#5, p.98]
	Truly, a glorious noise. [Nov 2003, p.128]
	Pushes the boundaries so far it's difficult to even call what they do "house" anymore. [Nov 2003, p.88]
	Where Basement Jaxx's diversity used to serve a club-DJ flow, here they let it off the leash, with mixed results. [Dec 2003, p.126]
	There's a recurring sense of enforced jollity.
	Each song here is crammed with all kinds of Kool & the Gang hand claps and Chemical Brothers bass drops. [Dec 2003, p.218]
	A naggingly problematic record, with a void at its heart that no amount of cool celebrity mates can quite conceal.
	Struggles to offer the same level of excitement that previous Jaxx albums provided.
