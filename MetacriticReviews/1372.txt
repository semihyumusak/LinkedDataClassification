Torture builds speed, human gristle, and institutionalization. Unforgiving ("The Strangulation Chair"), its Howitzer recoil runs molten currents of melody and rhythm.
	Nastier, harder and more devastating than 2009's Evisceration Plague, Torture attacks with savage precision from the opening seconds of the aptly titled Demented Aggression and never lets up. [Apr 2012, p.101]
	Torture is classic Corpse. No complaints.
	Torture delivers in overwhelming abundance, is walls of crushing noise, a great variance between the blastbeats and intricate rhythms, and some dazzling technicality. And that is exactly what you get.
	It's clear that the gore-obsessed band shows no signs of slowing down.
	The sounds on Torture are pretty much identical to what you hear on every other record by Cannibal Corpse: If it ain't broke, they aren't fixing it.
	This is more entirely predictably absurd bludgeoning death metal silliness from the kings of its kind.
