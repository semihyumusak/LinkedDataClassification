Miller's big challenge is that he follows in a long line of suburban college rappers who have thrown up whack mixtapes like they were yesterday's punch bowl, but this memorable debut steps right around that mess and suggests that the kids are not just all right, but all the way live.
	You know that breathless feeling you had when you ran from the cops after they broke up a house party? This album is that feeling in musical form.
	Miller exhausts his narrow subject matter pretty thoroughly over Blue Slide Park, but his life is so joyously carefree that it's hard to blame him for wanting to bask in it.
	The album as a whole saunters and bounces along.
	Blue Slide Park doesn't do anything to damage Mac's current status in the game, but it also doesn't do much to raise it.
	Miller sticks with a cruise-controlled slow burn for most of Blue Slide Park.
	Ultimately I have two complaints about Blue Slide Park which in the grand scheme of things may be minor.
	There was opportunity on Blue Slide Park to genuinely capture some real elements of youth, and the album doesn't capitalize on the opportunity.
	His obligatory jet-setter brags about high-dollar shopping sprees and b-words he's f-worded strain for credibility, not fooling anybody.
	Blue Slide Park ends up a charm-bereft everyman hip hop record merely ticking boxes required to shift units.
	He mostly raps on point and with confidence. But the actual words coming out of his mouth sound like they were brainstormed by a bunch of kids idling in an eighth-grade English class.
	His art is 144,487 times less remarkable than his first week sales numbers would have you believe.
