Ya Know cuts deep, with the best singing and wiliest melodies of his career. [Jun 2012, p.96]
	Unlikely but undeniable dynamite.
	For the most part Ya Know? comes across exactly as one would hope--like a collection of songs Joey Ramone would have been proud to share with the world.
	Ya Know?, assembled from a collection of demos, outtakes, and unreleased tracks, is by no means a "great album," and burdened by inexplicable timing, but it has enough fond memories to make it worth pursuing for true Ramones fans.
	Shows him clearly confident on his own.
	...ya know? manages to maintain a cohesive sound despite its disjointed source material.
	Despite a handful of tracks that sound exactly like, well, zombified demos, …Ya Know? has some fantastic moments.
	Nothing you wouldn't expect.
	Ya Know? is a loving and generous tribute to a beloved hero of the New York rock scene, but the results never match the energy, focus, and sheer rock & roll fun of even The Ramones' lesser efforts, and it doesn't work as well as Don't Worry About Me.
	It is a valiant, but ultimately fruitless attempt to add to the already brilliant back catalogue of the Ramones.
	While there are moments of punk-ish joy, this is a disappointing continuation of Ramone's genius.
	These 15 songs justify their status as outtakes. [Sep 2012, p.96]
	At 52 minutes, "...Ya Know?" is at least a quarter of an hour too long, and the individual songs – rarely more than germs of ideas – are dragged out beyond their natural span.
	Completely unaided by flat production and little or no deviation from one or two initial ideas, it's verging on an insult to the memory of one of punk's pioneers.
	Th songs are reductive, redundant, unimaginative, and dull. [26 May 2012, p.54]
