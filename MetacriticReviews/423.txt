The album finds the group covering some favorite songs and tying them together with its own rootsy flair.
	If you want rock 'n' roll to be galvanizing rebellion or something, Underwater Sunshine isn't the place for you. But if you want your rock 'n' rollers to offer a feasible career option that sounds great, the Counting Crows do.
	A few tracks offer something fresh.
	For all its heart, though, Underwater Sunshine still lacks the unborrowed inspiration necessary to come out of the gates as a stand-alone record.
	Underwater Sunshine (a play on The Soft Boys' classic Underwater Moonlight, another Duritz favorite) mixes live staples, pop classics, and more recent material from the Crows, offering the latest enjoyable, if inconsistent, glimpse into Duritz's record collection.
	What comes across is a band still in love with music, not necessarily their own. [Jun 2012, p.99]
