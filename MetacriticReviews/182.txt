Kenny Chesney does heroes George Strait and Jimmy Buffett proud on his latest set, which has a free-and-easy feel befitting its island inspiration.
	It's a slightly more commercial sequel to 2005's similarly mellow and nautical Be as You Are. Lucky Old Sun feels encouragingly personal for Chesney.
	Through the album, Mr. Chesney steers the songs toward half-smiles or at least a certain resigned acceptance, but he still sounds less complacent than ever.
	It's nice to see Chesney cast in a different hue (and this one's distinctly blue), but eventually Lucky Old Sun recedes into its own down tempo, like waves drawing out to sea.
	This is a quiet, introspective collection, predominantly an effort to find and take comfort wherever it presents itself.
	As a beach album, Lucky Old Sun is remarkably little fun.
	Chesney's sincerity is never in question, but his songs are uniformly garden-variety and obvious no matter how they are dressed.
	To be sure, there's some pleasure to be had here, but it's all about appreciating the album as pure texture: it's merely sunbleached mood music.
	The album proves how vapid contemporary country can be: Very. Uh-huh.
