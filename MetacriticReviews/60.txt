Lyrically, Polite rarely strays far from a seducer's template, but the way in which he sells the cliche is compelling.

	Unlike its predecessor, which gave Lloyd’s tender alto room to breathe, much of the production here is gooey and distracting, too dense for Lloyd to make a dent in.
	Throughout Lessons in Love, Lloyd sounds like he's actually having fun dishing out come-ons, adding an emphatic exuberance to each one.
