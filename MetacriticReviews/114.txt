Double Figure is as instantly memorable, not to mention listenable an IDM record as you are likely to hear this year.
	A showcase of complementary flavours that burst out of the electronica ghetto.
	Double Figure further fuses the themes fans have come to expect, but feels even more warm and organic than past efforts.
	Plaid's digitally inspired genius is to make electronic noises and the odd sample sound sad and celebratory, while occupying a spot on the dancefloor several galaxies away from Ibiza's gonzo techno
	Combining state-of-the-art sonic trickery with inventive rhythms, gorgeous melodies and - most importantly - solid structures, these 19 tracks represent Handley and Turner's most satisfying collection to date.
	Double Figure is as good as anything they have done. [#207, p.65]
	The disjointed juxtaposition of styles on this disc is so pronounced that it feels intentional; like The White Album or Jega's Spectrum, this record underscores its versatility at the expense of consistency.
	Double Figure forms a mysterious narrative filled with enough breaks and builds to keep the most jaded beathead more than satisfied. [Aug 2001, p.96]
	Plaid excel at the little moments where the music breathes -- moments all too rare within the regularized patterns of most beat-oriented electronic music.
	Much like Orbital, they have the ability to synchronize ideas without over-saturating their songs.... Unfortunately, at 19 tracks, there is plenty of ambient trickle filling in the gaps.
	The disc ranges from Vangelis-esque dirges to beautifully chiming background music to sprightly pop melodies, and Handley and Turner rarely fail to give the impression that somebody is in the studio pressing the buttons.
