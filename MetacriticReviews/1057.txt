Doiron's presence and Squire's understated electric guitar imbue the album with haunting, spectral beauty equal to anything Elverum's done. [Dec 2008, p.138]
	The result is a collection of songs so taut and concisely resonant as to be psalms.
	Lost Wisdom is not a long album--clocking in at just under 25 minutes--nor is it especially elaborate. Most of the songs rely on voice and guitar alone to make their case. And yet, how splendid they are, layered and looped in madrigals rounds and descants ('Voice in Headphones') or nakedly unadorned ('Flaming Home').
	Squire helps to mount these stories and itâ€™s this that makes Lost Wisdom last.
	This album sinks in, each listen dry rubbing the quiescent hums and lulls into the brain like a dream half remembered.
	These songs may be threadbare, full of holes and silence. But together Elverum and Doiron have made something achingly intimate, so that it feels more complete in its fractures.
	After years of solidarity, though, Elverum thankfully finds some much-needed human contact on Lost Wisdom, his most engaging LP since he retired Tthe Microphones moniker. [Year End 2008, p.80]
	Elverum is reveling in his honest moment of awe. In doing so, he has sloshed away the Norwegian frost with a mittened hand, a frost that kept these songs so chilling.
