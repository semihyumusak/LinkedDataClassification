That most welcome of albums: a great driving record that exquisitely soundtracks crushes and heartbreaks. [Feb 2007, p.89]
	Fans of transcendent and exact pop will delight in Casino Twilight Dogs. [#16, p.95]
	Youth Group's poignant and thought-provoking lyrics and storytelling style have pushed the group into the emo bag, but with their incandescent music, they're far too glittering to be left with that label for long.
	Throughout, group leader Toby Martin accelerates his ascent to bedroom bard of the medicated generation, filling Twilight with Zach Braffian tales of the perils that exist in relationships with girls (“Sorry”) and pills (“On A String”).
	Sure, you can wonder whether there’s a need for Youth Group with so many bands trying to replicate the success of Coldplay and Death Cab for Cutie, but Casino Twilight Dogs is worth a listen.
	Despite plenty of subtle charm and wistfulness, the band's implicit pursuit of warmth occasionally veers off course to flirt with surprising sterility. [Feb 2007, p.115]
	They wield massive choruses, stadium-ready production and the keening vocals of Toby Martin. [22 Feb 2007, p.80]
	This Youth Group record is a diluted version of already watered-down music; not only is it not as good as their first album, I’m not sure it’s as good as Keane’s first album.
	It's all soaring, boring hooks, ringing guitars cribbed from the last two decades of sad bastard Britpop and wussy vocals polished to a sleek finish that makes them ideal fodder for Hollywood soundtrack supervisors.
	Unlike other emo bands, Youth Group is blessed with a singer who can sing and a talented team of players which makes them slightly harder to write off. But only slightly, because the final straw [is] their lyrics.
	It's over-polished and lacks excitement. [Jun 2007, p.119]
	Just go buy an album that isn’t this one.
