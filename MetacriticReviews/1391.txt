He exudes a level of charisma matched only by Ludacris on a global scale.
	There are minor moments when Demo's slight r&b hooks miss and when Sway deviates too far from his good-natured strengths, but the lion's share is ace-- thoughtful but not pedantic, funny but not stupid, sincere but not treacly, realistic but not boring.
	This will end up flying off the shelves for sure.
	Strikes a winning formula of DIY integrity and big bucks sheen. [Mar 2006, p.110]
	His supersonic flow frequently dazzles, yet he remains intelligible and intelligent throughout. [Mar 2006, p.106]
	An eclectic vanguard sound. [Jul 2006, p.88]
	There's no denying Sway's dazzling verbal chops and it's not just the speed and flow of his delivery that impresses....

	The occasional ordinary moment confirms a suspicion that Sway only really excels when he's playing the comic foil. [Mar 2006, p.88]
	A quality contemporary UK rap album with equal shares of bleepy, futuristic and poppy, everyday music and plenty of singing to support a rapper that clearly isn't just rapping because everyone else is. Still, there's room for improvement.
	There's a feeling that This Is My Demo is just geared too much towards the commercial audience.
