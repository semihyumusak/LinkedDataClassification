I was a huge fan of Low before A Lifetime Of Temporary Relief, but the perspective it casts both by amassing so much of their beautiful music and by casting new light on the people who make it make this box set utterly essential.
	In the years to come, Low will trudge onward across the vast tundra of gross underappreciation, but in retrospect, their canon will likely be seen as one of the most important and influential of our time, so you might want to start paying attention.
	Loaded with delights... that highlight their soft, uniquely beautiful sound. [Sep 2004, p.135]
	This is sombre and beautiful music.... A Lifetime is satisfying as an encyclopaedia of Low, to be dipped into now and again. [Aug 2004, p.118]
	Fathomlessly beautiful. [Aug 2004, p.110]
	Unlike the typical odds-and-ends set, A Lifetime Of Temporary Relief could bring more fans into the fold, and it'll surely satiate those who've been listening closely to some of the last decade's most rewarding music.
	Put [the covers] all together and you get an idea of Low's surprising range and versatility.
	It flows like a scrapbook rather than a novel, but it portrays them as diligent experimenters and meticulous melodists who have been liberated by embracing restrictions. [Sep 2004, p.155]
	For even the most ardent Low listeners, this box set (in all its packaging design perfection) will overwhelm.
	One could hardly expect a three-disc set of Low's castoffs, demos and flipsides to dazzle.
	The biggest kicks come from the bedroom demos and odd covers of songs like "Blowin' in the Wind," but only the initiated will be able to stay awake long enough to hear them.
	Don't start here before the essential LPs... But once you've fallen in love (and believe us, it's inevitable), this is a mesmerising next stop. [17 Jul 2004, p.48]
