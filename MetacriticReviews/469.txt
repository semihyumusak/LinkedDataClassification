Ingram may be good on his own, but Patty Griffin's sweet harmonies on the enchanting 'Seeing Stars' and Dierks Bentley's growls on Ingram's live classic 'Barbie Doll' are welcome additions.
	Ingram's latest doesn't fit the definition of a work by an artist, because this set isn't original in any way. It seems that he can not only live with this compromise, but he freely chose it, and celebrates it here.
	While it's easy to wish that Ingram took the concept of artistry more seriously, this album makes it clear that he's comfortable with the compromises he's made. He may be capable of more, but Hopes certainly isn't bad for what it is.
	Jack Ingram was named Top New Male Vocalist at last year's ACM Awards, but the Faustian bargain this respected Texas veteran made to strike it rich in Nashville is abundantly clear.
	Four producers besides Ingram are listed. And still he's come up with another generic disc of heartland rock that some call country.
