To fans that listened to Rage as a means to get "pumped up" and bring the "mosh" you’ll probably be disappointed by the lack of work out music. But to the fans of Zack’s militant poetry, listen and enjoy.
	There isn't any filler here; it's all the aural ignition of a gasoline bomb going off in your ears.
	The music is stripped-down but robust, with de la Rocha on vocals and keyboard and Theodore on drums.
	It’s a five-tracker with bite, with venom; it’s a reminder that while de la Rocha might age like the rest of us, the fires in his belly haven’t come close to being doused by mundane revivals of his most famous group’s mosh-happy hits.
	Along with the recent string of Rage-reunion gigs, this set shows the rapper-activist stepping back into the arena, and dude's on fire.
	This EP cannot be recommended for who I consider our core group of readers unless you are familiar with his previous material and know you enjoy it, but the level of talent is undeniable.
	While this project marks a long-overdue move forward, it can’t help but feel like a step back. It’s not the content that’s timid, but the ambition.
	The sound quality is, by all accounts, mediocre, but the raw nature of the music reflects the “one day” aspect of their motto.
