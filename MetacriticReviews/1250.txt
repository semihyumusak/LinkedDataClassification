Dead Media thankfully brings the focus back to personal matters, and it sees a breath of fresh air introduced in the form of analog synthesizers and audio experimentation.
	As surefooted a return to form as could be.
	At best, Dead Media delivers tuneful, hilarious, pathetic tales of lost schoolboy love. [Mar 2002, p.81]
	Hefner is new at this, so things get clumsy. But it's endearing, because [Darren] Hayman's melodies and the idiosyncratic worldview he espouses are still irresistible. [#53, p.79]
	The band covers this cerebral terrain with renewed vigor, thanks to a sudden fondness for antique synthesizers and battery-powered drum machines. [Feb/Mar 2002, p.112]
	It begins to wilt with tedium as it continues, as the drum machines and synthesizers give way to unimaginative organic instrumentation and bland, stale melodies.
	Dead Media works on occasion, but primarily when Hefner revert to the traditional pop trio format of bass, guitar, drums.
	The new electronic direction is likely to lose more fans than it gains.
	You have to admire Hefner's artistic spirit -- but Dead Media is too flawed and derivative to earn serious praise.
	Most of 'Dead Media' resembles a third rate Pulp, Denim or Babybird - steeped in tales of sexual disappointment in bedsit land but without the considerable charm, warmth and wit of the aforementioned bands.
