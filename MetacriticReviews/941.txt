Ultimately, it's Up on the Ridge's overall aesthetic that proves Bentley's deep respect for-and his legitimate, intuitive understanding of-country traditions, even as he uses those traditions in forward-thinking, progressive ways.
	While it's unlikely country radio will champion this album, somewhere in the great beyond, Bill Monroe is smiling approvingly.
	Dierks Bentley epitomizes the New Nashville ideal, but on Up on the Ridge he goes old-school with a set of acoustic bluegrass jams.
	These cuts may not have the snap of classic bluegrass, but they do give Up on the Ridge a sense of country crossover, illustrating that Bentley is shrewd enough to walk the line between commercial and artistic concerns.
	His established fans will appreciate his foray into some new territory, and casual fans can use Up on the Ridge as a stepping stone to discover another closely related genre of music.
	Up on the Ridge works best when it fully embraces the bluegrass concept, rather than trying to meld it with other country sensibilities.
	His voice is too plain to deliver the pathos in songs like Buddy Miller's "Love Grows Wild." But the record succeeds on high spirits, sterling guest stars (Miranda Lambert, Jamey Johnson) and covers like U2's "Pride."
