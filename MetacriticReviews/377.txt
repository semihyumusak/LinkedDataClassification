It's not your mother's, father's, sister's or brother's cup of tea, but for fans of D12 and/or Hunter S. Thompson, "Hannicap Circus" is one crazy trip through the mind of a lunatic.
	Hannicap Circus is solid, filthy, fun, and everything else that you'd want from a less nimble Kool Keith.
	Songs like the predictably ribald "Porno Bitches" are little more than by-the-numbers, behind-the-music tracks. [Jul 2005, p.104]
	Shock gets dull, though, and Bizarre's bloated debut is profoundly unfunny. [Jul 2005, p.115]
	Flaccid beats mean that his solo debut -- despite guest spots from Eminem and Big Boi -- too often falls flat.
	He can't work out whether to explore the moral darkness or just go for cheap laughs, so he does both - neither very well.
	If crude tales of incest, child abuse, drug abuse and just about every other type of abuse are your thing, then... "Hannicap Circus" is for you.
	The problem with shock, of course, is that it quickly loses its novelty, and anyone who doesn't find the topics of pedophilia, drug abuse, or incest innately hilarious will find Hannicap Circus rough going.
