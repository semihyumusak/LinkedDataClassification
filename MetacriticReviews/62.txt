The disc's gritter sound, courtesy of producer Steve Earle, is a perfect complement to Sexsmith's "Waterloo Sunset" croon... [6/8/2001, p.76]
	Sexsmith doesn't succumb to a single false move or note. [#51, p.112]
	A very clear sounding Sexsmith singing in his Tim Hardin-quaver about the art of song, the loss of love and other intense philosophical insights that only a softspoken guy would concern himself with.
	Sexsmith's gorgeous vocals and refined songwriting shine through.
	Longtime fans may be put off initially by the loose exuberance of "This Boy" and the bluesy goof "Not Too Big," let alone the ska-flavored fluke "Never Been Done," but even these atypical tracks play to Sexsmith's strengths.
	The loose arrangements nod to the American roots icons Sexsmith idealizes; there's tons of feel. [Aug 2001, p.139]

	Enjoyable, but a gold star or two short of his 1997 masterpiece, Other Songs.
	Ron Sexsmith actually rocks, albeit only sort of and irregularly.
