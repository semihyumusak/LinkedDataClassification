The production is perfect - not too cluttered, lush, beats melting beautifully into the now-understated guitar - and his vocals are warm and unpresuming.
	Somewhere in there Brown's murmurous vocals and the lyrics tend to get lost. [Sep 2001, p.99]
	No song is quite right: a lyric about angels or elephants here, a trip-hop beat there, and even the Milky Way would blush.
	Lacking the strangely compelling shambolic glory of his first solo album Unfinished Monkey Business and the crisper soul-warrior posing of second solo set Golden Greats, this album isn't going to fulfill Brown's hopes of bettering The Stone Roses' debut.
	Musically it is by far and away his most complete offering but some cracks do show.
	An improvement over his lo-fi solo debut and his over-produced second disc, but it misses as often as it hits.
	You can see the Angel/Heaven/Cocaine lyrics coming a mile off and the predictable bass that punctuates them soon becomes just as banal.
