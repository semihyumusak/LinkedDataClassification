The songs he's written with new acolyte Sorren Maclean and Idlewild bandmate Rod Jones are more assured than ever.
	[Woomble] continues his journey into cozy-pipe-and-slippers-middle age on 12 folk-pop tracks which further distance him from his angsty, indie rock beginnings.
	Idlewild's Roddy Woomble has made a surprisingly decent stab of his concurrent career as a born-again folkie. [May 2011, p.126]
	Like island life itself, it's quietly focused and won't be rushed. [Apr 2011, p.104]
	It continues where his 2006 solo debut, "My Secret Is My Silence" began, mining the seams of British folk with out descending into chunky-jumpered sentimentality. [May 2011, p.103]
	While Woomble has a gift for an engaging lyric, the same perhaps cannot be said tune-wise.
	This collection of tracks lacks that vibrancy and spark needed to linger long in the memory. There are a few sunny moments here and there but ultimately it's disappointingly flat.
