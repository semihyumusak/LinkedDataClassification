An enthralling emotional powerhouse propped up by fantastic post-punk that rips your head off and then gently sews it back in place. [Apr 2003, p.74]
	This record is a composite of everything that is good about modern music.
	Organ raises the Saddle Creek bar in terms of sheer psychiatric-rock intensity. [Listen 2 This supplement, Mar 2003, p.10]
	The Ugly Organ is greater than the sum of its parts, with tracks that flow into one another seamlessly in spite of the wildly varying tempo and stylistic changes, not surprisingly like a classical piece in that regard.
	The best punk record you'll hear all year, articulate and amped all the same. [#58, p.86]
	Kasher's jagged, jarring song cycle suggests an unholy fusion of the Cure's Robert Smith and Sebadoh's Lou Barlow.
	A brilliant leap forward.
	Splendid, splenetic stuff. [Apr 2003, p.102]
	A challenging, yet highly rewarding listen.
	With the groundbreaking stab at emo self-analysis, Cursive deserve at least a boost out of the emo ghetto. [Apr 2003, p.122]
	A potent piece of rock art.
	Unfortunately, the album is too top-heavy to be seaworthy, the back end full of Fugazi knockoffs and half a song stretched out to ten minutes in a forced attempt at a showstopping finale.
	Somehow The Ugly Organ has enough pop appeal and pseudo-uplifting sentiment to make it listenable.
	Cursive employ musical inventiveness and a healthy dose of self-awareness to set themselves apart. [Apr 2003, p.102]
	This is a very odd album. [Apr 2003, p.103]
