It's a record full of deep, freaky grooves.
	Keenan sometimes winks too much, but he knows when to pull back from the brink of ridiculousness. [Dec 2007, p.125]
	Vagina finds Keenan attempting a fresh spin on the style. He doesn't always hit the mark, but the perpetually distorted, faux-sultry vocals ('Queen B') and visceral dance beats should elate those who've been itching to pull their old My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult T-shirts out of storage.
	The lyrics--delivered in a borderline sexy-creepy style that sometimes veers into Gregorian-chant territory--range from esoteric and dark to crude and dumb.
	Not every album can be a tour de force, but Keenan is normally much better than this even on his worst days.
	The problem with the album goes past its unmemorable music.
