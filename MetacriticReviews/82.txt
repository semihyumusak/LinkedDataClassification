Startlingly good. [29 Sep 2006, p.80]
	The songs here are superb, the arrangements and production nearly perfect, and Jackson’s singing is the best of his career.
	An uncommonly rich and moving album.
	If there's a downside to this brilliant, if unlikely pairing, it's that Krauss's somber program could benefit from something a tad more libidinous or uptempo.
	What surprises most about Like Red On A Rose is how well this departure suits Jackson.
	2006's uncanniest country record.
	Jackson ties everything together with his own understated strengths, a sincere manner and grounded perspective that anchor tunes even as they brim with thoughtful passions.
	Despite the individual quality of almost every song and performance, there’s simply not enough variation of style, rhythm or mood on Like Red on a Rose.
