Despite its flaws, Hudson's debut comes on much like her "Dreamgirls" character, with admirable self-assurance and real-girl sensuality.
	Hudson is so comfortable with singing--whatever the song might be--that she elevates the material, making it sound like nothing you've ever heard before. All hail the new diva.
	None are exceptional, but they're all a sufficient delivery system for those spectacular vocal chops.
	Few vocalists as young as Hudson have a voice that is as versatile and expressive, proficient enough to pull off a multi-dimensional set of R&B songs, yet her debut is as tricked out as that of an artist with a small fraction of the talent.
	By the time Jennifer Hudson gets back to good old-fashioned balladry, it's too late: we're saddled with the same Diane Warren song ("You Pulled Me Through") we've heard at least a dozen times before; a ridiculously trite and histrionic you-stole-my-man duet with fellow A.I. alum Fantasia ("I'm His Only Woman") we've heard at least a half-dozen times before; another Stargate/Ne-Yo concoction we've heard...well, you get the point.
	She has a magnificent voice that deserves a lot better than this formulaic pop and soul.
	Stylistics paralyze Hudson's debut, but it is her impassioned talent that keeps the album on life support.
