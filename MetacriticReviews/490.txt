This gentle, suave, insistent smoothie parlayed his direct lyrics and tricky beats into a strong straight r&b album in a year when contenders Raphael Saadig and Me'shell Ndeg√©Ocello got tangled up in form.
	Having already redefined garage last time around, he's conjured up an album equal parts R Kelly, Ali G and Terence Trent D' Arby, which will only send him further into the stratosphere.
	What makes the stop-and-go, drum-thick music on this CD such a smooth ride, is that despite the pout, this is still the same old David. [#12, p.140]
	Way more consistent than your average over-long US R&B release, whilst still being stuffed with just as many potential singles.
	Thank goodness David can still lay down some good pop balladry. [22 Nov 2002, p.78]
	Unfortunately, he's traded some of his cutting-edge British mergings (R&B, hip-hop, two-step, rock) for a more crossover-friendly (read: formulaic) approach that doesn't fire on all cylinders.
	David's pasteurized pop may not be pleasing to all musical palates, but for many, he remains one of the United Kingdom's tastiest exports. [Jan 2003, p.130]
	When songs hit their mark, his latest incarnation squares up impressively to his Stateside heroes. [Dec 2002, p.97]
	This is one of the most subtle male R&B records in a good while.
	Slicker Than Your Average is stronger than the average sophomore effort, and it proves that Craig David's abilities are innate.
	Slicker Than Your Average too often slides that slippery slope to mainstream blandness.
	Expends a lot of energy hating the haters and growling at the gold diggers. [Jan 2003, p.99]
	An album that features all of his worst tendencies and almost none of his good ones.
	The banal production has been reduced to the average backing track that accompanies every other modern soul singer. [Dec 2002, p.78]
