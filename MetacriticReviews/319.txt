Patty Loveless has an innate soulfulness that can't be taught, bought or won on a reality show. That's one of the reasons-along with sterling musicianship and inspired song selection-why her new album, Mountain Soul II, is a must-have for fans of Loveless and roots music alike.
	Since 2000, every record she's released has been at least as good as the one that preceded it, and this is no exception.
	While commercial country radio today may find the latest Loveless record boring, you can blame this on country musicâ€™s lying, cheating, cold, dead-beating, two-timing, double dealing, mean mistreating, loving heart. Loveless still kicks butt.
	This sequel similarly mixes hard country and mountain music, memorably on Harlan Howard's "Busted" and a plaintive "Half Over You." [Feb 2010, p.93]
	It's still a beautifully crafted, expertly performed record (and certainly a standout in what has been a pretty wretched year for country music), but the scope and thoughtfulness that made "Mountain Soul" such a treasure are absent.
