When he caters to changed times, the results are forgettable. But when he stays in his lane, there's no one who can snarl a couplet quite like him.
	Enough things are right that you can't go wrong with The Last Kiss, but the key is that the album makes you want Jadakiss to stay in the game instead of hanging up his sneakers and walking off the court.
	The Last Kiss ends up a reasonable, though backward-looking, outing.
	With his latest long player, The Last Kiss, the Yonkers heat spitterâ€™s exquisite rhymes again get lost in an overabundance of boilerplate attempts at hits.
	Jada's too talented to produce a completely worthless album, of course, and there are the usual one or two frustrating glimmers of the promise that keep getting him record deals.
	This problematic arrival shows too in the final product, but the problem may not be the much maligned rapper's ability or inspiration but the constant mishandling of his material. So many prime street cuts have been given away to comps, mixtapes, and soundtracks in the five years since Kiss of Death was released that only the slick, polished numbers remain.
	There are no such standout cuts here.
