Starbucks should replace Norah Jones with Holland as its mood musician of choice; her compositional brew is smooth, with jolts of witty malice.
	Holland gracefully achieves the spookiness and timelessness artists like Tori Amos and Cat Power have been chasing for years.
	She sounds as distant as much of the Anthology of American Folk Music, and yet there is an intimacy to her songs. This is a singer/poet who really feels things. And this is the new, weird America, and Holland is singing its woes with a wisdom far beyond her age.
	It's difficult to think of a more compelling sophomore record by a young singer-songwriter, Norah included.
	Another relaxed but enigmatic foray into modernist roots territory to stand alongside records by Gillian Welch, Laura Veirs, Sparklehorse and Bonnie "Prince" Billy. [Jun 2004, p.98]
	It really is incredibly good, even if sometimes it's hard to feel you're hearing the real Jolie and not a character she's adopted. [Jun 2004, p.110]
	It's the voice that does it - all hazy smoke and dusty cotton, this time sounding like she's channelling Billie Holiday.
	Her jazz-tinged voice soars; the music manages to be both wonderfully austere and subtly strange. [Jun 2004, p.98]
	Musically, Holland could be considered the more eccentric and authentic second cousin of Norah Jones.
	A listening experience that is singular, startling, and soulful.
	For lovers of all strands of Americana -- not to mention those who revel in the effortless performance of a truly unique singer -- Escondida is a little treasure, and a beguiling addition to any collection.
	While self-diversifying is a perfectly acceptable (and sometimes glorious) approach to recording a fully realized, internally cohesive album, Holland's scope periodically makes Escondida appear non-committal and/or scattered.
	[Holland] has been rather mistakenly compared to Billie Holiday; sheÂ’s more like Jeff Buckley covering Nina Simone, turning a very modern ear toward yesterday.
	If Norah Jones and Gillian Welch are the sunny side of the roots revival, then Jolie Holland is Grapes of Wrath darkness. [#7, p.73]
	Her music embodies a dyed-in-the-wool timelessness that can't be counterfeited.
