Clearly, Kem isn't self-conscious about his love of love--and we love him for it.
	His voice is clear over the sparse arrangements, and his words are more direct than before.
	On first listen, the disc seems unassuming because of its subtlety, but slowly it reveals its layers. The tracks about love, devotion, and transcendence are refreshingly honest and (mercifully) lacking in leering lasciviousness.
	The arrangements on his third LP embody the title's Intimacy, complementing his honeyed vocals with gentle acoustic strumming, soft taps on a snare drum, and occasional understated keyboard and brass lines.
