An unexpected but endearing valentine to the 1940s and 50s.
	At its best it's a wonderful homage, at its worst it's a vanity project.
	Sincerity marks a refreshing change of pace for MacFarlane, but it never transcends the gimmick of hearing the guy who created Family Guy sing like the Rat Pack.
	MacFarlane and McNeely don't attempt to ape the pizzazz of Frank's Reprise years, nor do they spend much time with May's snazzy snap, they stick with Riddle and Jenkins, keeping things sentimental and lush even when the words crackle with wit.
	The result is alternately audacious and befuddling.
	This is an utterly pointless record with no artistic merit, creative spark or genuine ambition whatsoever.
