Warm and confident throughout her second album, Hilson is becoming hard to ignore.
	This zigzagging sophomore disc, No Boys Allowed, suggests she's not quite sure where to go next.
	There are a few tasty future-pop moments, but mainly it's predictable r&b, weighed down with tiresome, ersatz sexiness.
	Impressive, then, that this boy-army, one-girl team was able to pull off a contemporary R&B album so feminine, breezy and thankfully low on ballads.
	Hilson loses focus with hookless songs the busy production can't save, while the MCs largely shoot blanks.
	Ms. Hilson's own records aren't tipping toward bona fide dance music as much as Rihanna's, and don't yet have their audience-strafing sweep. But a few songs here are good enough to stop the overthinking comparisons
	Her second album is hit-or-miss, with failed attempts at pop crossover (the Timbaland collabo "Breaking Point") and sub-Rihanna reggae moves. Still, the high points are worth digging out.
	The mixed messages are infuriating, and the complete lack of soul or identity perplexing.
	Her follow-up isn't merely eager to stand out but rather desperate, as if the studios in which it was recorded contained a clock counting down to the point of failure, the moment when Hilson would no longer stand a chance of being a ubiquitous, multi-platinum superstar.
	In glimpses it reaches that goal--like in maybe half of the sticky and finessed "Breaking Point"--but it's undone by the album's many other contradictory messages.
	Keri is so very...what? It sounds like she's making a move at Chaka-Whitney "every woman" territory, only with a few key differences.
	No Boys Allowed doesn't match its polished predecessor success a whole project.  The songwriting feels more in line with her R&B/Pop peers than anything else.
	Though Hilson sings like a sweet-voiced dream throughout, No Boys Allowed is muddled and devoid of the gutsiness the title leads us to expect.
