Unfortunately, Rule 3:36, which does feature a few worthwhile moments, doesn't string enough strong tracks together to be a cohesive, effective listen.
	While the album is full of quality tunes that sound nice in isolation, as a complete package, it lacks the versatility to take it to another level.
	With Rule 3:36, Ja Rule takes a step forward from his impressive debut album, spending less time trying to act hard, and focusing more effort on crafting a diverse album.
	Rule's sandblasted voice is as memorable as ever. But his unmistakable vocal presence is wasted on joints that fall way short of the impact made by his breakthrough hit ["Holla, Holla"].
	Ja Rule plays it painfully safe on his second album, doling out pop hooks over gimmicky production.
