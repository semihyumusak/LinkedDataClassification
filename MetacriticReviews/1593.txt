The occasional recorder and kazoo only add to the weirdo charm of this very fine album.
	Pop Tune finds the Japanese three-piece in fine form, exhibiting a wide-eyed freshness all the more remarkable when you consider that they have been a going concern since 1981.
	Pop Tune is in the top handful of records that Shonen Knife have released; a slight update on the rougher sound they pedalled in the first half of their career, but it still sounds DIY-enough to please the faithfuls.
	Thankfully, the Knife have remained true to their essential principles.
