An eclectic Walmart-only mini-album, Cyrus works her ?husky chirp over big-beat disco-garage (''Talk Is Cheap''), paranoid synth-rock (''Kicking and Screaming''), and ?Les Miz-style power balladry (''Obsessed'').
	Cyrus has always sounded older than her years, and as she leaves her teens, that's a good thing--especially since The Time of Our Lives shows her music is catching up to her pipes.
	The Time Of Our Lives is a great pop EP drowning in a sea of bilge.
	"Party in the USA" is a cute pop song, with a clever clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as hook. But it's downhill from there, thanks to a run of inferior ballads arrested only at the very close by one rather superior ballad, "The Climb."
