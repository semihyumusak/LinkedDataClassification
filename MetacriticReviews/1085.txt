He's settled into this well-weathered skin on Clancy's Tavern, winding up with his best album in many a moon.
	Overall, another solid effort from one of country's finest.
	Much of Clancy's Tavern--named after a bar Keith's grandmother once ran--strikes a quieter, more intimate note.
	Clancy's Tavern is dominated by songs of a different stripe, most of them about losing love or trying to cope with its loss.
	An eminently dependable outing that's strong on solidly crafted, confidently delivered songs but nearly devoid of surprises or revelations about his artistry.
	Keith has always been predominantly a singles artist, but Clancy's Tavern has a surprisingly high percentage of songs that play as afterthoughts.
