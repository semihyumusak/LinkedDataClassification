A brazen, heartwarming, classic '70s bardic rock album, spirited enough to compete with and instruct the Ashcrofts and Gallaghers.
	Sadly, theres no escaping the fact that Squires solo debut is a one-paced, uni-directional affair.
	He still fires the occasional lyrical blank and his guitar playing has less of the sparks of the past, instead settling into a role complementing the songs rather than dominating them.
	This bloody enormous rock demeanour means Stone Roses fans may not be amused. [Oct 2002, p.96]
	If you can get over the voice--and it is not a lovely thing--Time Changes Everything at least has curiosity value. [Oct 2002, p.104]
	Squire's voice is awful, while his music and lyrics are those of a busker. [Nov 2002, p.113]
	If this was the work of a new artist it's debatable whether it would even have seen the light of day, and it's certainly unlikely we'd've felt the need to even comment on it.
