Custom Built boasts the talents of both Miley Cyrus and Jason Miller from goth-metalers Godhead, who offers a brutal remix of the Rock of Love theme.
	The fresh material isn't likely to expand your idea of who Bret Michaels is.

	Writing this review would be so much easier if you didn't seem like such a nice dude and if you hadn't had such a disaster fraught year so far. we'd totally let into you about that Miley Cyrus duet and probably scold you for including that atrocious remix of the Rock of Love theme, but frankly, we can't. Not now anyway.
