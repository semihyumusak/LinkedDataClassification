If you haven't discovered Stereophonics' live show yet, Live from Dakota is a good place to start.
	The songs hold up well live, and the recording quality is terrific.
	Rather than try to duplicate the new-wavy sounds of their current output, the trio smartly keep the sound consistently raw, and lead singer Kelly Jones hasn't sounded this inspired or dangerous since 97's Word Gets Around.
	Stereophonics, like their countrymen Manic Street Preachers, are equally adept at making the slow, infectious ballad just as pleasing and appealing as they are with harder rock tracks.
	A handy "best of the Stereophonics--for now." [8 Apr 2006, p.39]
	This is one for hardcore fans only and casual listeners will be better off waiting for the inevitable Greatest Hits compilation.
	Despite the hysterical crowd response, Live From Dakota is as meat'n'potatoes as its creators. [May 2006, p.130]
	Joyless but effective. [May 2006, p.124]
