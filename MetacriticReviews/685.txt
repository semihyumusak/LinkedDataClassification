A pretty good modern rock record that will make Weezer fans happy.
	The tunes are sub-Weez, but the vibe is right. [Mar 2004, p.96]
	The Special Goodness' has crafted a dozen punk and pop-influenced songs that the modern rock hoi polloi will have a hard time leaving alone.
	Makes you smile without even really listening because the whole sound is such a cheering mix of grunt and grin. [May 2004, p.104]
	An indie version of Weezer's arena emo.
	Alas, those wondering where Weezer would be without Cuomo's most delicious hooks will learn that, too. [23/30 Jan 2004, p.99]

	This collection of warmed-over power pop wouldn't have shown up on anyone's radar if it weren't for Wilson's day job as Weezer's drummer.
