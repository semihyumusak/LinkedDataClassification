The New Pornographers have made such a great album, tuneful, overdosed with hooks, that all the past sins of our Northern neighbors are forgiven. Well, maybe not Rush, but close.
	More than the sum of its influences--even if it occasionally feels like a stack of Cars, Cheap Trick, and early XTC albums melted together--Mass Romantic throttles from strength to strength.
	Mass Romantic more than repays any musical debt owed by the good people of Canada. In fact, itâ€™s going to take some pretty strong efforts by America's best and brightest to match The New Pornographers' achievements here.
	It's an album that reveals its charms through repeat listens, and makes a listener wonder how the band can master so many different musical styles via so many vocalists while still maintaining a fiercely cohesive sound.
	Their peppy, gleeful, headstrong guitar pop sounds a hell of a lot like yesteryear's Britpop.
	A record that's certain to be name-checked by pop savants 20 years from now.
	They borrow from Cheap Trick, the Beach Boys, Big Star, Roxy Music, Buzzcocks, and Robyn Hitchcock, and concoct a dizzying potion that sounds remarkably fresh and unlike anything that's come before it.
	A rather erratic affair. [Apr 2002, p.119]
