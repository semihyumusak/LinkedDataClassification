The duo inject tracks like "Then I Go Twisting" with more humanity than the Pro Tools post-modernists who regularly steal their essence. [7 Oct 2011, p.75]
	Tomorrow's World appeals to fans of Erasure's later albums just as much as it appeases those who swooned along to A Little Respect in 1988.
	There's a cohesiveness issue that keeps this one off their top shelf, but Erasure have settled nicely into that groove that the best veteran bands often do.
	The duo's hook-laden, dangerously infectious, bottom-wiggling formula is still in place. [Oct 2011, p.112]
	Tomorrow's World isn't a bad album but it's not a complete "return to form" either.
	Sometimes it feels like he's competing too hard with the intensity of the big, expensive-sounding production--especially on the mid-tempo numbers.
	Its peaks aren't as high as [2005's Nightbird, or 1997's Cowboy's] standouts--there's no "Don't Say You Love Me" or "Rain" here--but most of these nine songs have big choruses that sneak into your head, sometimes against your better judgment.
	There's a glistening sheen here, and the mixture of fast and slow ("When I Start to Breathe" is ballad-like with an eminently hummable chorus) keeps things refreshing.
	The nine-song set shows that keyboardist-mastermind Vince Clarke's genius for weaving grand melodies with ecstatic beats is still intact, but tinny vocal compression muddles throbbers like "Whole Lotta Love Run Riot."
	Reconvening after a four-year hiatus, the duo have carried on where they left off--meaning the Frankmusik-produced TW is gentle, blissful and devoid of the exuberant electro romps of yesteryear.
	It's early Erasure fans who seen likely to enjoy the '80s electro sheen of the all-action rhythmo-melodic hooks and subplots. [Nov 2011, p.100]
	Even with Frankmusik included among the production credits, these one-time synth-pop pioneers sound lifeless compared with all the 80s-raiding whippersnappers so indebted to them.
	Business as usual, then, with few new thrills.
