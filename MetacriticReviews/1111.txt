I Created Disco is not only the title of Harris' full-length debut, it's also the title of a track on the album that threatens to depose Justice from their perch on high.
	I Created Disco feels renegade, and that's what makes it more than irresistibly fun synth-pop.
	The bulk of the record follows suit, with straightforward club songs, none too obtuse.
	His is an intrepid sound, taut and gorgeous. [Oct 2007, p.92]
	I Created Disco is a fun and mostly very listenable pop record which satisfies the modest ambitions it sets for itself.
	Harris has distilled all of the synth-popping, amp-busting sounds of electroclash and disco-punk into a complete set of proper pop uppers.
	Throw in some straight, viscerally melodic vocals and a few cool, smart, electro-pop and digi-funk sing-alongs and you have a classic four-song EP--if not an entire album. [Sep/Oct 2007, p.129]
	This is an indie rocker introducing great disco to a bunch of beer drinkers. [Nov 2007, p.150]
	Harris doesn't need to sing--his electronic noises from the keyboard are quite sufficient.
	Calvin Harris does nothing out of the ordinary, but still, he does it well.
	Good times are to be had, but don't go looking for anything deep. [Summer 2007, p.90]
	Harris's frivolous humor loses its charm when the music falls flat.
	The problem is that I Created Disco goes on for nearly an hour and barely changes tack once.
	Overall I Created Disco is just a pretty confection, good for transient enjoyment at best.
	Harris reduces pop's limitless possibilities to one-joke self-parody, his youth his most distinguishing characteristic, an unremembered yesterday always more vibrant than today.
	I Created Disco is witless and forever tripping over its own feet.
	Leave this to collect dust in the bargain bin. Or, better still, the bins out the back of HMV.
