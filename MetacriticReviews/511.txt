There are some songs with giddy-up, especially the big bounce of 'Get Involved,' featuring Timbaland and Missy Elliott. It doesn’t fit with the rest of the disc, but who cares when it’s this great a ride with a cool Timba groove and Elliott’s sly, quick verse?
	It's a decent set of modern R&B, dominated by seductive slow jams, that stimulates a little more often than it fades into the background.
	Ginuwine’s new material uses a more generic palette of sounds from R&B slow jams and gospel. There’s more song to them, more piano-ballad chords and swirling Isley Brothers guitars, and more mediocrity.
	Ginuwine sounds more than comfortable throughout, and succeeds in making fundamental R&B with a good deal of replayability.
	A handful of uptempo highlights aside, the rest of the disc turns out to be an unduly generous helping of syrupy bedroom pleas that'll have you wishing Ginuwine had decided to keep some of those Thoughts to himself.
	With only a few exceptions, the material here doesn't live up to his performances, making the music easier to admire than to enjoy.
	It’s a serviceable album, but for an artist like Ginuwine, who created three near perfect albums, this is a cynical attempt to stay relevant.
	It's not as if he overdoes the sexism or sounds like a total lame, although his voice does crack slightly.
	It almost inevitably fails to live up to those lofty aspirations. [Nov 2009, p.114]
	Poor man’s Usher wallows in hip-hop cliches.
