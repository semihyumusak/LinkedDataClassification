One of 2003's best releases.
	Rarely has rampant misogyny and self-hype sounded as fantastic as this.
	50 Cent's star appeal and the other member's solid skills make Beg For Mercy a solid debut album.
	Amazingly, 50 and his crew are able to imbue such crassness with a sort of rough-and-tumble charm, winning you with their sheer boisterousness and the fun-house spirit of the music. [21 Nov 2003, p.84]
	Even though the cast spends an inordinate amount of time treading over the subjects Fiddy already hit with his own Get Rich or Die Tryin'--dope, guns and themselves--tracks like "Poppin' Them Thangs" and "Groupie Love" have just the right mix of humor and heat to make them stand on their own.
	Stronger than most star-fronted posse records.
	Beg for Mercy doesn't measure up to Get Rich or Die Tryin', but then, how many rap albums do?
	Mostly, it's tight but standard. [Jan 2004, p.114]
	50's signature wit is notably absent, so the fate of G-Unit hinges largely on his posse. [Jan 2004, p.104]
	Seriously poor, lowest common denominator bullshit.
	A pale retread of Get Rich... fashioned by lesser talents. [Feb 2004, p.69]
