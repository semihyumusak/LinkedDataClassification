Though this material has been rereleased ad nauseam, Squeeze obsessives will eat it up. For everyone else, it's a reminder that songs like ''Take Me I'm Yours'' have aged surprisingly well.
	That passionate energy is what makes each song sound so fresh and exciting, even though it's intentionally not new. Difford and Tilbrook are writing for the next Squeeze album, but for now fans can play Spot the Difference.
	Impressively artful forgeries all round--but unlikely to appeal beyond their diehard following. [Dec 2010, p.105]
	Although this is never less than excellent fun, the originals are still the best. [Dec 2010,. p.96]
	It works. And not just because Tilbrook's high and mellifluous voice has only ever-so-slightly thickened and Difford's lower register--used for great deadpan effect on "Cool For Cats"--defies aging concerns, but because these effortlessly clever, tuneful and pithy songs never got their full due in the U.S.
	Sure, there is nothing new in these tracks, but it is surprising how well the songs stand up after so many years.
	The game at the core of Spot the Difference may be mostly meaningless, but it tricks us into a different kind of comprehension, granting a new face to songs that now no longer seem as stale.
	While this hardly supplants those originals, Spot the Difference is a fun spin for the devoted and a good advertisement for Squeeze's reunion tour, proving they still have the knack to entertain.
	The likes of Up The Junction and Cool For Cats still sound fabulous, but it's a mystery why they didn't just remaster one of their collections. [Dec 2010, p.114]
	You can't really go wrong with such great material, but this cynical ploy to sell an oldies tour is completely superfluous.
