With the high-gloss Flo Rida, less is more, meaning this eight-tracker is entirely right-sized.
	If this was pop music with terrible lyrics and shitty beats that hurt my ears, you know I'd tell you so (see Soulja Boy) but nothing on Only One Flo (Part 1) would make me want to change the station if I heard it on the radio.
	Unfortunately, Flo Rida seems weirdly reined-in on the rest of this eight-track mini-album Only One Flo (Part 1),
	Only One Flo embraces the electro pulse of international clubland, with hedonistic lyrics to match. But although Ludacris and Gucci Mane inject momentary charisma, Flo Rida mostly flows as anonymously as any dance diva.
	In a business where artists come and go with quickness, Flo has managed to remain relevant. Only One Flo will only strengthen Flo's relevance, but it will never be mistaken for a solid piece of art.
	The fact that he sings many of his own hooks might seem like a useful skill, but the combined blandness of his singing and rapping only increases the overwhelming blandness of Only One Flo, an album that seems insistent on reminding us how dispensable he actually is.
