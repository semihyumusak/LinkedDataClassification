Man vs. Machine is an intense set that never stops.
	Even if this is business as usual for Xzibit, then at least business is good.
	Xzibit's best efforts are done in by the usual culprits -- misogyny, crudity, and blinding bravado.
	As a whole, Man Vs. Machine signifies a dialectic vacillation between lyrics and beats that are refreshingly intelligent, without being pretentious, and themes (manifested sonically and ideologically) that are recycled and uninspired.
	Much of the material features clamorous, heavy-handed production, and though Xzibit's subject matter ranges from orgies to the benevolence of his mama, his dexterous rhyming style is a little too undifferentiated. [#10, p.132]
	The last holdover from Xzibit's underground days is also his sole weakness: cartoonish hooks that sometimes spiral solid material off in an awkward direction. Otherwise, Man vs. Machine is state-of-the-art.
	Xzibit's rhymes lack bite.
	You best spend your time listening to older Xzibit joints and wait around for the next one to buy new.
	Entertaining, largely forgettable. [Jan 2003, p.120]
