In the transition from imitator to originator, the old boy has made one of his best albums ever. [Oct 2011, p.83]
	The humour is often savage--a sprightly accordion heralds a story of damaged troops--but Cooder's aim is true. He's become a Woody Guthrie for our times.
	The sound of the album is deliberately vibrant and varied.
	Magnificent.
	It's a relief to report that Pull Up Some Dust And Sit Down is his best effort by far since Chavez Ravine.
	This doesn't rock, and it shouldn't. But it rollicks, skanks, and two-steps just fine.
	Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down (Nonesuch/Perro Verde) ranks not only among his very best releases, but among the best socio-political albums ever made.
	This is about as good and sustained a riposte to the grubby, grabbing times we live in as any artist has mustered, which makes it essential listening.
	Pull Up Some Dust And Sit Down could have tremendous cathartic power for this who are aware of history and its knack for repeating itself. For those who are willing, this is a good place to start an education.
	The famed slide guitarist and world music enthusiast releases his most incisive and sardonic political album.
	This is revolution music; worthy of dancing to, learning from, and singing along with: who says topical music has to be boring?
	The heartening sounds of an old master at work. [Oct 2011, p.117]
	From the title's Depression-era jokes onwards, Cooder protests like it's 1939. [Oct 2011, p.96]
	Although Pull Up Some Dust... delves deep into both North and South American musical history and moves rapidly from style to style, there is scant scope for quibbling over Cooder's honesty or authenticity.
