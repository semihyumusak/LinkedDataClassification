An album that has all of the elements necessary to be a pop classic.
	Jim Guthrie has created a masterful soundtrack of peace and tranquility, similar to the crowning achievement of another earthly troubadour, named Sufjan Stevens.
	It's a lush, gorgeous record, but it's also small and still, full of unassuming first-person monologues.
	Frankly, the results are incredible.
	We adore this album and are pretty sure most of you will, too.
	Now, More Than Ever is both hushed and sprawling, serene and agitated, jumpy and constant.
	A pleasantly lush album that may be his finest work yet.
	Immersed in beautiful, stirring string arrangements, heartfelt melodies and an all-around warm and welcoming down-home folk feel, the new album is sincerely soothing.
	Guthrie successfully matches his idiosyncratic lyrics with subtle, layered arrangements lush with strings, crisp guitars, and shifting song structures as likely to burst into anthem or lilt towards confession.
	Acoustic without being folksy, poppy without being pandering, and quirky without being annoying. [Oct 2004, p.144]
