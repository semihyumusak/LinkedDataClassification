With no one expecting it but themselves Starsailor have delivered.
	The major surprise is just how on top of their game they sound on this orgy of melody. [Apr 2009, p.110]
	They’ve yet to match "Love Is Here" lyrically, and in that department, All the Plans might be their weakest yet. But with song structures so strong, and presentation so majestic, it’s well worth overlooking the few flaws for the sake of the intoxicating whole.
	As is so often the case though all it takes is a fall to flush away fanciful tendencies and with All The Plans they revisit wholesale what it was that made them a draw in the first place (other than sounding a bit like Coldplay).
	It's anthemic ('Tell Me it's Not Over') and slushy ('Hurts Too Much'), but it might just work.
	Clanging rockers, elegant ballads, and yearning epics are testement to their diversity, while James Walsh has almost managed to lose the bleat in his voice that used to drive Starsailor's critics to distraction. [Apr 2009, p.99]
	All The Plans is full of driving piano, anthemic guitar, and a bit of swagger. They owe a huge debt to Coldplay, Ocean Colour Scene, and Oasis which, in itself, must be quite galling.
	You try to remember a single melody or hook from the record and you're found wanting. [Apr 2009, p.99]
	It’s a horribly calculated, horrible slice of anthemic horribleness. Throughout, dreadful lyrics are in abundance, pianos are thumped and drums are bashed.
