Universal Pulse is the band's best release since 2001â€²s From Chaos.
	No hooks on their 10th album are big enough to snag newbies, though melancholy anthem "Weightless" comes closest. [29 Jul 2011, p.72]
	311 saves the best for last with the last quarter of the album.
	On its 10th studio album, 311 perhaps was aiming for familiarity yet falls short at tepid.
	Universal Pulse can be wearying even at its half-hour length.
	On album number (gulp) 10, 311 are still really freaking psyched to be 311.
