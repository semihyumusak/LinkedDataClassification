Haters can hurl epithets toward Drew and NSN as much as they want, but the singer's sincerity simply cannot be denied.
	What Is Love? is a very enjoyable record and a lot better than what I expected. Christofer Drew has given his listeners a taste of his potential, because, musically, he knows what he is doing.
	His first album, What Is Love?, is light acoustic pop on which he shows melodic skills. But Drew took some bad lessons from emo and his dad's folk record.
	Ingle's ability to write a pop melody is promising, perhaps, yet it's too hampered by nasal vocals to make much of an impression, and the albumâ€™s short running time proves to be one of its biggest assets.
