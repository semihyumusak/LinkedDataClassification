As a record, this The Sea of Memories is easily the most enjoyable collection of songs released under Bush's name.
	The quartet's first record in a decade is a surprisingly vital viva-la-grunge manifesto.
	The Sea of Memories will most likely please those few Bush fans who've been hoping for a reunion, but it will not change the minds of those who relegated Bush to nothing more than a disingenuous rip-off of so many more brilliant '90s alterna-rock acts.
	Memories does indeed trigger some, particularly when a big-chorused rocker ("The Afterlife") opens up like a razor-blade suitcase. As for the ballads, you're better off YouTubing "Glycerine" -- or one of the tearjerkers ("Forever May You Run" ) from Rossdale's underappreciated 2008 solo disc.
	What The Sea of Memories does is inject some life into the Bush brand, proving that Rossdale isn't ready to call it a day.
	The Sea Of Memories plays like an endless replay of Rossdale's past musical miscues.
	The Sea adds exactly zero entries to the totally awesome Bush greatest-hits album that doesn't exist yet. [23 Sep 2011, p.79]
	Bob Rock's big production ladles on the reverb, merely emphasizing hollowness at the core. [Dec 2011, p.81]
	As far as comebacks go, sadly, this is not a good one. [29 Oct 2011, p.52]
	It's a mediocre album, and I'm only being hard on you because I sincerely wanted more. Like a pissy parent, I'm not mad at you... I'm disappointed.
