Overpowered's bubbling, sensual, and soulful glitterball gems effortlessly tap into the perennial glory of feeling lost and lonely at the disco at the end of the world.
	While the commercial potential of her new album may be up for debate, as a showcase for Rosin Murphyâ€™s talent, Overpowered is an enormous success.
	She's melded the two sides of her history much more seamlessly; four-to-the-floor pop belters mix with touches of electronic and lyrical darkness to make one of the pop albums of the year.
	This is an album that exceeds expectations and is unlikely to disappoint those who do bother to listen to it.
	In a year of low-stakes disappointment for European pop, Overpowered is a triumph.
	The joyous next single, 'Let Me know,' along with dark gems such as 'Primitive' and 'Movie Star,' make this close to a modern synth-pop classic. [Nov 2007, p.90]
	Crucially, her songwriting has deepened and matured. [Nov 2007, p.146]
	The result is a delight. [Nov 2007, p.115]
	Overpowered is both impressive and incredibly fun, but fun in a way that "Ruby Blue" wasn't: you don't have to think here.
	Overpowered is a silvery mirrorball of a record that perfectly illuminates the neon heart of Saturday night.
	Not once does Overpowered really drag its feet, but it never truly impacts with the might one could possibly expect from an artist with such a fine pedigree.
	The result is a thoroughly modern pop album that will best appeal to ageing clubbers.
