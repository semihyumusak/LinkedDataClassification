While the record maintains a strong sense of uniformity, it never lapses into monotony, thanks largely to the poetic turns of songs such as "Blackbird" and "Slow" but also Rumer's consistently powerful performances which culminate in a singular and impressive artistic statement.
	An undiscovered diamond.
	An immediately engaging debut, Seasons of My Soul has the potential to repeat the crossover success of Norah Jones' Come Away with Me and Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, its unquestionable authenticity signaling the arrival of an equally timeless and unaffected voice.
	Rumer's debut is an immediately engaging, gently engrossing set. It wears its cracked heart on a neatly stitched sleeve of the most luxurious fabric, strong and elegant despite the hardships that sit of the centre of every song.
	[It] has the pleasing sense of an album made to the artist's vision rather than the focus-grouped demands of the marketplace: almost uniquely in its chosen milleu, Seasons of My Soul sounds like a hit album without sounding like all the other hit albums.
	There's a maturity about Rumer's delivery that sets her apart from all the Duffys and Adeles.
	Seasons Of My Soul... rarely moves above midtempo or out of 6/8 time, and in its warm duvet of production it makes for a soupy listen, even more so on the second or third spin. But that won't diminish the album's efficacy as music for dinner parties or - let's face it - tender baby-making.
	Throughout, these 11 songs give the impression of being sweet nothings. They are, instead, substantial and salty with tears.
