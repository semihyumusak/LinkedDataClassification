A darkly, slathering record of frustration and disillusionment, â€œLanguage. Sex. Violence. Other?" may, in time, even come to be seen as one of the true masterpieces of the noughties guitar revival.
	The punk-inspired spark that made their 1997 debut, Word Gets Around, so impressive is rekindled.
	An excellent modern rock record. Dense, intelligent, user-unfriendly and challenging. [12 Mar 2005, p.57]
	Stereophonics have never sounded so brooding, mysterious and -- dammit -- sexy. [Apr 2005, p.122]
	The music may seem invigorated and fresh, but lyrically, the usual ingredients are all present, correct and indigestible as ever.
	Fierce, minimalistic but defiantly pop-sensible hard rock. [Apr 2005, p.88]
	This album will not bear up to being played too often.
	In some ways is a step backwards towards their rockist, meat-and-potatoes roots, and in other ways is a quantum leap into the unknown.
	A masterclass in menace. [Apr 2005, p.97]
	Jones still croaks out songs with that wretched voice of his, an amalgam of nicotine, alcohol and AOR. The guitars still churn out feeble riffs more appropriate for a Hot Wheels commercial than a grown-up's rock album, and even when they're on to something it feels like they're only fumbling with a good idea.
	They sound like a marginally smarter American modern-rock act, screaming their pain over raw-boned riffs that could sure use some technicolor pizazz.
	For all of his wild swinging, Jones never fully connects. [May 2005, p.136]
	Stereophonics have in effect 'done a U2', packing in the arena-filling songs but with added AOR. Elements of rock dinosaurs such as ELO, Chicago and Fleetwood Mac all crop up over the course of 11 songs.
	The ham-fisted attempt to modernise Stereophonics' sound... falls flat at every attempt as samples, effects and the odd electronic buzz avoid the underlying mulch like gas-gun fired dried peas off titanium.
