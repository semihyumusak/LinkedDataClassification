Kanye West's debut aside, it's the essential hip hop album of the year so far. [Jun 2004, p.102]
	Tical 0... takes that voice and plugs it into more than a dozen tried-and-true rap templates. [Jun 2004, p.104]
	While Tical 0: The Prequel is an adequate and at times entertaining record, too much collaboration has overshadowed the rhyming prowess and lyrical wittiness of Method Man.
	Feels like surprisingly generic party rap. [May 2004, p.126]
	Meth's rugged rhymes still flow with effortless finesse, but for the first time, he loses his identity. [14 May 2004, p.68]
	It's, well, a thoroughly professional record. And therein lies the problem. Method Man, perhaps more than any other Wu-Tang member bar ODB, has personality to burn, and trying to force it into a box fit for any other hit rapper is an impossible task.
	[He] sounds stuck in a rut. [June 2004, p.152]
	There's a sense of urgency when he is inspired by the production backing him, but when the beats coast along without much flair, Method Man does the same.
	The killer swarm of 1994's Tical and Tical 2000's astro-black ambition aren't anywhere to be seen. [27 May 2004, p.80]
	Give or take a couple hot tracks, this release is not likely to play a significant role in his legacy.
	A weak Meth album produced poorly and without imagination in the main, by an assortment of losers, with each track featuring a guest emcee.
	This album is 80% total shite.
	Bogged down by Meth's lackadaisical approach and reliance on guest appearances, Tical 0: The Prequel falls flat on its befuddled front.
