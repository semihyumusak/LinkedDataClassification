This self-contradiction makes him as human and vulnerable as the rest of us, and that is this album's true charm.
	Doin' It Again is unlikely to cross over in the same way as its several collaborators have done, but hardcore grime fans should be satisfied that at least one of their originators hasn't surrendered to the ubiquitous electro-pop sound just yet.
	Like most grime, the words come thick and fast, as do the beats, a feeling of punch drunkenness settling in long before the end. Job done, then. [Mar 2011, p.116]
	With a distinctive, authentic voice and a sharp sense of humour, Doin' It Again may not make No 1, but it ought to allow Skepta to continue palling around with P Diddy in the knowledge he's still keeping it real.
	His is a paradoxical, somewhat clean version of grime, pushing every commercial button to boost his product. [Mar 2011, p.101]
	Beyond the sonics, the lyrics are embarrassingly piss-poor as well.
