What sets Red Devil Dawn apart, though, is a sense of personalized tragedy that Bachmann hasn't addressed much before.
	Red Devil Dawn is a welcome masterpiece of emotional subtleties -- the great record that Crooked Fingers missed the mark on with 2001's drunken, bluesy and somewhat disappointing Bring On the Snakes.
	On Red Devil Dawn, Crooked Fingers have made huge strides towards becoming one of the most fascinating bands in some time.
	Bachmanns transition from indie curmudgeon to singer-songwriter is complete: his arrangements are now horn- and string-fattened creations of grand sophistication; his songs now contain hope and broken spirit simultaneously; but the most significant growth displayed on Red Devil Dawn, and the reason this album is Bachmanns finest moment since his Barry Black days, is that you can now see Eric Bachmann as the subject of most of his songs.
	The lyrics on Red Devil Dawn are some of his most poetic to date.
	His most accomplished song cycle to date.
	Fans will eat up this new record, as the songwriting rivals, and often exceeds, the best of Crooked Fingers' prior curious work.
	The album's not a step forward so much as a squirm in quicksand.
	Red Devil Dawn reveals the ex-Archers Of Loaf leader gaining momentum with his latest incarnation, which bodes quite well for future releases.
	Red Devil Dawn is as intricate and bewitching as the work of Tom Waits or the Tindersticks.
	Red Devil Dawn is by far the most consistent Crooked Fingers album, and in many respects, probably the best in general.
	A rewarding, re-listenable collection of solid rockers and ballads.
	It's not an album that will change your life, but it could alter the way you look at bits of it. [Feb 2003, p.64]
