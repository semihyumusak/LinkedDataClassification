A majorly impressive debut. [Aug. 2011, p. 100]
	An impressive debut, albeit one light on lyrical depth.
	There's a great and more conventional singer/songwriter album waiting to get out here, but The Lateness of the Hour appears to be more concerned with creating a bold statement of intent than in showcasing Clare's undeniable talents.
	From dancehall/nu-metal hybrids to dubstep-meets-Bond theme balladry, its bombastic stuff, but also finely tuned in its balance of sincerity and showmanship.
	With a little more focus and a natural approach, he could find himself a unique voice that sits outside of the styles he is trying to embrace.
	Much of it is a coffee-table approximation of the producer duo's more irreverent work. [Aug 2011, p.89]
	All in all, the overriding impression left by The Lateness Of The Hour is that Alex Clare is a fairly gifted gentleman. But here his talents have been squandered on a collection of songs that fail to establish him as either a dance-pop titan or an emotive warbler.
	Lateness never does much to prove Clare and his producers were on the same page (let alone reading from the same book).
