If Ian Curtis had stuck around for Zoloft and Hot Hot Heat, Joy Division's Closer might've sounded a lot like this album. [Dec 2004, p.158]
	Punk funk can be a prickly thing, but they never overdo the art-rocking, always placing the emphasis on melody. [Feb 2005, p.101]
	The album's flat production values eventually dull the rhythm section's choppy bite.
	Dangerous Dreams is a passable album that never achieves greatness, nor does it fail miserably, rather residing with the mundane.
	It's not so much that [they] sound a bit like The Rapture so much as, occasionally, they seem to be running off Xerox copies of specific Rapture songs. [29 Jan 2005, p.58]
	Dangerous Dreams is plagued by a pervasive feeling of been there/done that, and the album ultimately sounds like the same two or three tracks on repeat.
	Dangerous Dreams is just such a mixed-bag of goods that it's hard to feel much about it other than a couple of standouts.
	A case of too little, too late, nothing on Moving Units' full-length debut Dangerous Dreams does anything to disprove the feeling that the dance-punk scene is at best overcrowded and at worst approaching rigor mortis any day now.
	Without DFA tricknology to enliven their mix, they struggle with monotony over the course of an album. [Mar 2005, p.94]
	If you’re a fan of the genre, don’t bother with Dangerous Dreams unless you’ve absolutely exhausted your current dance records.
	Dangerous Dreams' late arrival was nearly enough to doom it to obscurity, but the disc's lack of new ideas puts the final nail in the coffin.
	Dangerous Dreams is either an homage to an homage or a flimsy extension of a fading movement; regardless, its been-there, done-that mediocrity is ultimately what defines it best.
