An old-school indie-rock disc reminiscent of Bettie Serveert, Rainer Maria, and Liz Phair.
	A wonderful balance of beautiful indie rock and subtle country.
	One of the best indie rock albums you're going to hear this year.
	Producer Mike Mogis [gives] these delicate songs a sheen that was lacking on their 2001 debut. [Jul 2003, p.114]
	Sentimental post-country tunes knock against acute lyrics about rent, overbearing parents and other aspects of the pre-midlife crisis, as rock-out moments keep grimness at bay. [#11, p.140]
	When they're on, they're really fucking on. [Dec 2002, p.94]
	A dynamic album with intriguing lyrics, a country/folk shimmer, and explosive pop moments.
	At times slightly overdone, but on the whole enormous fun. [Jul 2003, p.111]
	The songs are pretty, the guitars are mellow, all complimentary and measured; dull, in other words.
