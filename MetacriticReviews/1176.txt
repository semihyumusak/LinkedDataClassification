Most strikingly,  Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa displays a masterful control over the multi-faceted Cradle Of Filth sound; brutal vocal gymnastics, skull-rattling double-kicks, symphonic flourishes, dramatic narrative and balls-out axe-slinging all make their presence known, but in a manner which routinely serves to bolster the coherency of the greater whole.
	Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa is a masterpiece of extreme metal creation. With some of the best compositions of its career, the highest-quality lyrics in its history, and none of the misfires it has suffered in the past, Cradle of Filth has delivered one of the best extreme metal releases in recent memory.
	The concentration on writing and arrangement is disciplined, with a strong set of dynamics, a terrific mix, and great production, and of course the lavish package lives up to the band's reputation as well.
	On its own merits, rather a hoot. [Jan 2011, p.83]
	All the usual COF ingredients--the abrasive vocals, the dexterous buzzsaw riffage, the furiously prop propulsive drumming--are present and correct, but here they're channeled into more streamlined songs while the more melodic elements are often pushed to the fore. [23 Oct 2010, p.50]
	Dani Filth's ninth album ramps up the Carry On Screaming! schtick; the result is one he's behind you short of a pantomime. [Dec. 2010, p. 103]
	Orchestral additions are cool, but here they dominate both in terms of volume and notes-per-minute, transforming potentially aristocratic black metal like "The Cult Of Venus Aversa" and "War" into poorly layered sonic slop. [Dec 2100, p.111]
