Doolittle channels Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin over live-band arrangements that feel fresh-faced and old-school at the same time.
	Doolittle is nothing if not steady, making all the right moves at the right times, sounding at once like a seasoned pro and someone who feels everything she sings while never forcing or faking anything out. It's one of the smartest, most likable albums from an American Idol alum yet.
	Unlike other albums maniacally programmed to target every pop niche (hello Jennifer Hudson!), Doolittle delivers one of the rarer qualities you’ll find in a contemporary album: a clear sense of who she is.
	That her backup occasionally lets her down, though, ultimately speaks to how confident Doolittle sounds here. Coming Back to You is an impressive opening salvo--even without the "for an American Idol" qualifier.
	While Ms. Doolittle does well with these hand-me-downs, the process feels oddly like a sequel to the “Idol” experience.
	It’s pop music, and the surface sounds great--and maybe that’s enough in pop music.  But Coming Back to You feels a little but deeper, and that’s not a bad thing either.
