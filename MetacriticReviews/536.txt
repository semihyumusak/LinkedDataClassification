Pullhair Rubeye is significant not because of its aesthetic and non-conceptual disposition, but also for its dedication to instinct and brave novelty (in the best sense of the word).
	The whole thing possesses the air of a woozy reverie, a gentle disengagement from reality. [Jun 2007, p.162]
	It's like they rented studio time in the red room from Twin Peaks.
	Pullhair Rubeye isn’t awful, but it could’ve been great.
	Three or four listens in, though, and very much against my will it started to become enjoyable as (im)pure sound.
	The album is seriously frustrating.
	I highly recommend that Animal Collective fans seek out the re-reversed copies of Pullhair Rubeye [available illegally on the Internet]. They are enjoyable.... But then there's, you know, the thing that sits on store shelves and costs money. And that version of Pullhair Rubeye is remarkably dull.
