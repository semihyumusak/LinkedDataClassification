Here the folk legend rings in the new with songs from the old, sensitively produced by Joe Henry.
	This is not so much a reinvention as another way to look deep into the heart of Elliott's music. It's also an early nominee for folk album of the year.
	Ramblin' Jack Elliott has teamed up with producer Joe Henry to deliver a starkly dimensional and soulful collection of dark blues. [Winter 2009, p.94]
	These dark, old blues tracks have never sounded more haunting.
	illustrates how slight the distinctions between country, blues, and folk genre labels are, and it adds to Elliott's legacy as one of popular music's finest storytellers.
	Elliott is better at world-weariness than he is at sass, but has enough guile to mould the songs in his own image.
	Although it contains some fine backing musicians here, notably Van Dyke Parks and Los Lobos’ David Hidalgo, Henry uses them to accent Elliott’s unique sound rather than to accompany him.
	Elliott brings a seen-it-all authenticity to this repertoire while Joe Henry's sympathetic production (aided by guest appearances by Los Lobos' David Hidalgo and Van Dyke Parks) is pitch perfect.
	The pre-WWII country blues that the 77-year-old honed under the tutelage of Woody Guthrie are in full bloom on 'The New Stranger Blues' and 'Soul of A Man'. [Spring 2009, p.77]
	It's on those songs that strike a chord with Elliot personally that he's most convincing. [May 2009, p.103]
	Now in his 78th year, all that know-how has been meaningfully brought to bear on this collection of vintage, Depression-era blues. [May 20009, p.112]
