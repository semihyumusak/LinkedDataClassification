Even at his least inspired he's got these funk-rap-metal boys beat.
	Other old rockers sound old. Iggy sounds brutal, harsher than last time, louder than ever, a pummeling self-production pocked with magnificent metal dumbness... [Sep 2001, p.88]
	His most consistently slamming release since 1990's Brick by Brick.
	It proves to be a violent, uncompromising record throughout...
	This return to blitzkrieg riffing is closer to nu-metal than old Stooges. [Aug 2001, p.136]
	His loudest, most adolescent and downright unwholesome album since the Stooges imploded nearly thirty years ago.
	'Beat 'Em Up' is not shit but ain't exactly loveable either. However, it does confirm that Iggy Pop can still kick up a fuss with the best of them even if the end result isn't as legendary as the man who produced it.
	A major improvement over Avenue B's acoustic midlife crisis, this self-produced disc finds the Ig yelping off the top of his id again. [27 Jul 2001, p.72]
	His backing band's heavy-metal veering leans toward the generic. Only the Igster's sometimes fierce (but fading) yowl adds enough soul--and insanity--to make them at least momentarily credible.
	Iggy's own production fails to lift it out of the nu-metal quagmire - sometimes the perfectly executed power chords and unimaginative guitar licks feel every bit as raw and dangerous as Bowie's Tin Machine farrago.
	Finding Iggy as confused as ever, Beat 'Em up ranks alongside New Values and Blah, Blah, Blah as yet another missed opportunity. (#209, p.60)
	It's all third-rate bar band stuff.
