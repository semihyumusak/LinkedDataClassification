Though the content of We The Best Forever is what we've come to expect from a DJ Khaled offering-grandiose odes to the grind and getting yours-that he understands how to create those better than most is what makes a DJ Khaled track, and album, worthwhile.
	Be prepared for an experience somewhere between a star-studded soundtrack and a DJ-helmed mixtape.
	At this point listeners are either down with his movement or they aren't, and while We The Best Forever is a solid piece, it's not different enough from his previous work to change any minds about him.
	It just goes to show that on a DJ Khaled album, you can't be Eddie Van Halen. You've got to be David Lee Roth.
	As usual, his imperial victory-march hip-hop songs are fun, and mildly exhausting.
	He's found time to let some truly enjoyable music slip through the cracks again, whether they were favors as much as personal concoctions or not, and while one still gets the feeling Khaled views these artists as products on a shelf as much as human beings, it's nice to know he still knows a good song when he hears one.
	The Miami radio DJ and Terror Squad member takes few stylistic chances, making We The Best Forever a mostly tedious listen despite its flashes of lyrical invention.
