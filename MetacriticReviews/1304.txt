The album makes clear that these men really like music. They like singing it; they like playing it. And theres enough fun being had here to convince you that you might like hearing it as well.
	Its clear from the beginning that Bell can handle the vocal chores but what remains questionable is Clarkes ability to rescue his beats from the predictable morass of synth pops stodgy past without, of course, overdoing it.
	Erasure do the Ronettes' "Walking in the Rain" almost as well as Cheryl Ladd, they do Buddy Holly's "Everyday" better than James Taylor, they prove that one man and one man only was meant to sing "Can't Help Falling in Love," and they tart up Peter Gabriel something fierce.
	Erasure transforms each number into something tailor-made for a staged musical. [Jan 2003, p.74]
	Showcases the melodramatic but never overstated croon of a showman who, in another era, might've been a Las Vegas legend. [#14, p.135]
	Overall, the album plays too stiffly for these experts of synth-hewn dance/pop.
	More often than not, they connect with the material in unexpected ways.... Problems occur when they can't find a convincing way to graft their highly identifiable sound onto the song.
	Carrying none of the charm or innovation of the duo's earlier ABBA tribute, this set is salvaged only by a relatively straight reading of Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury Hill."
	The results have a better chance of ending up in mom's Volvo than your iPod. [Jan 2003, p.76]
	Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury Hill" loosens up into a glittery anthem, while the Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" should have stayed a karaoke favorite. [March 2003, p.94]
	Startling for all the wrong reasons.
	The results are risible but the joke is no longer funny. [Feb 2003, p.77]
	So ill-conceived and shoddily executed it could well finish them off altogether. [Feb 2003, p.102]
