Wrapped in the sonic wonder of Mark Linkous, Fear Yourself is more than a great record, it is a brilliant one.
	Fans will enjoy his latest installment of heartbreak set to piano. [Mar 2003, p.92]
	Sad, pretty, funny and touching. [#14, p.137]
	A fierce, defiant record. [Apr 2003, p.108]
	These love songs aren't the kind that make you giddy, but Johnston's ability to articulate the naked foibles of human emotion and Linkous' somnambulant soundscapes elevate Fear Yourself beyond easy platitudes.
	An admittedly flawed but remarkably honest document of one person's struggle to believe in love.
	Uneasy, strangely compelling listening. [Mar 2003, p.111]
	Unfortunately, Fear Yourself's intricate, careful sound results in a rather bland album.
	The failing voice at its core would clearly be happier in the privacy of lo-fi. [Mar 2003, p.106]
	The problem with Fear Yourself is not that it sounds big, rather that it sounds condescending to the man it's supposed to be all about, and more importantly, by.
	Not even Linkous can prop up this house of cards for long. [#58, p.94]
	Johnston's voice rarely melds with Linkous' production, and it loses its gritty charm amid such dignified surroundings.
