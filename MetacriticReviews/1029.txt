The release does establish Simple Plan as on e of the most consistent acts making music today. [Feb 2008, p.109]
	Simple Plan's plan--to get you bouncing, bobbing, and otherwise grooving--is still simple. And like all uncomplicated strategies, it's still remarkably effective.
	Simple Plan is a shameless little heatseeker, which isn't much of a musical problem. Provided you're after a good time, several cuts make excellent use of keyboard bleeps and drum-machine beats.
	The whining hasn't let up (see 'No Love' and 'Generation'), but the fun hasn't either. Credit the producers.
	The group's third full-length album, the simply titled Simple Plan, offers glimpses of something more, but invariably falls into to the same old pattern.
	All things considered, this Plan to update their sound winds up being too Simple.
	Album three aims for maturity, but the results are stunted.
	There are some decent pop moments: 'When I'm Gone' is a seize-the-day anthem with a cathartic refrain. But most songs, like the angry barnburner 'The End,' are barely distinguishable from a dozen or so other Warped Tour bands.
	Like Good Charlotte and Fall Out Boy before them, these multiplantinum Canadian heartthrobs have finally covered up their pop-punk roots completely, on their fourth album. [Feb 2008, p.99]
	Simple Plan continue to plough forwards wuth a punk template of such box-ticking efficiency that they at times resemble automatons. [Mar 2008, p.111]
	Think Lavigne's "Girlfriend" without the hooks, but with a discernable degree of emo introspection.
	This isnâ€™t music so much as it is economic exploitation of a demographic.
