Throughout, Berg never loses his appeal.
	The problem here is that the near single-mindedness of his subject matter on Look What You Made Me shows EXACTLY what he's been made by one too many music videos with jiggling booty and coochie--a nymphomaniac.
	From the confrontational album title to the cuss words, Berg is working to shake the pop tag and turn it hardcore with a baller stance that isn't so much embarrassing as it is uninteresting.
	Heâ€™s likeable but dull, rapping with nursery-rhyme cadence and simplicity. When he attempts intricacy, his words fall all over one another, scrambling for dry ground.
	As an MC, Berg is workmanlike with few crisp rhymes and bereft of ideas beyond lining his pocketbook.
	Look What You Made Me will burn brightly for a few more weeks on the strength of its club readiness, but with Berg's flaccid delivery, misguided confidence, and no desire to shake up well-worn subject matter, the album should fade into oblivion like so many other disposable pop-rap LPs.
