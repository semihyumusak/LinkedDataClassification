The constant changes of direction can be a little jarring on the first couple plays, but they eventually become one of the album's charms.
	Mya's third album should have no problem hanging with the chart-topping competition, seeing how it's stacked with hit after steamy hit.
	Nothing else on the album [other than single "My Love Is Like . . . Wo"] is quite so perfect a vehicle for Mya's predatory sexuality.[
	Whatever her emotion, the eclectic Mood Ring effectively captures the evolving sensibilities of this rising star.
	At best, Moodring exhibits some minor genre dabbling, but truthfully, Mya's source material hasn't broadened much.
	Though she doesn't add any real depth to her artistic sack, she captivates by revealing another stage in her development--as a woman. [Aug 2003, p.148]
	Mya gets lost on Moodring. [#18, p.128]
	On previous outings, with tighter pop sensibility intact, I never noticed how thin Mya's voice sounds. But with an album constantly swishing in languid R&B balladry it sounds like a sugar wafer caught in a lawnmower blade.
	Infinitely bland. [Oct 2003, p.111]
