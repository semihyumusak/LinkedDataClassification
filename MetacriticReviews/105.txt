While not every song is up to a "Moves Like Jagger" or "Payphone" standard hook-wise, the co-writers and producers never stopped breaking into new grounds for the band throughout the record.
	It's top-shelf radio sucrose.
	It's when he deviates from the plastic norm that he actually sounds most awkward.
	Overexposed is rather patchy and its highs are countered by some fairly wretched lows.
	The band's newest album is likely to alienate longtime followers and music snobs alike, but will undoubtedly excite newer fans who embraced their massive smash hit "Moves Like Jagger."
	Overexposed may not hold together as well as that album [Hands All Over ], but it's sure to keep the audience won over by The X Factor.
	The hooklines and characteristic high-shine production are there, but don't quite replicate 2011 single Moves Like Jagger's blue-sky charm.
	On much of the album, which never quite finds a balance between rock grit and dance-pop glitz, Maroon 5 barely sound like a band at all.
	Overexposed is not a great album, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting. What we're hearing is the band actually learning to have fun again, and with any luck, they'll only get better from here.
	'Sad' is an Adele-apeing weepie, 'Payphone' has a guest rap from Wiz Khalifa, and both 'Lucky Strike' and 'Fortune Teller' feature cod-dubstep breakdowns.
	It marks the first time Maroon 5 has completely receded into its songs' glossy production.
	Otherwise every passing second is a vocal battle against a declining attention span, like a clicked finger in the face, forever.
	Maroon 5's sudden decline with the Mutt Lange-produced Hands All Over seems unlikely to be significantly overturned by the lacklustre Overexposed.
	The sooner this bunch of plums fade back into obscurity, the better.
