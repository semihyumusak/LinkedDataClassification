	For the most part, He Was King emphasizes pop accessibility--and it often does so with catchy, likable results.
	Masterfully bleak and hyper-stylized, He Was King is music for the robot age.
	He Was King is tasty candy, to be sure. But it's the sort of candy that only makes you want something more substantial. Like cake.

	Ultimately, He Was King is electro-pop on autopilot.
