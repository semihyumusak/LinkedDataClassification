Confrontational, clammy, brimming with confidence... Royal Society is as majestic as its title implies.
	This record is full of the illogical, instinctive, incomprehensible poetry that the BEST Rock & Roll lyrics are made of, and contains some of the most distinctive and indeed brilliant music of the last ten years/twenty five years/ever/let's get more carried away.
	A demented, disjointed, delicious-as-human-rump-steak modern classic. [23 Oct 2004, p.49]
	[Singer Guy] McKnight's baritone, which could earn him a packet doing horror movie voiceovers, injects melodrama into songs already drowning in it.
	Explores themes of mental derailment and the black arts against a backdrop of the heaviest psychobilly, grunge-metal and stoner rock. [Nov 2004, p.106]
	Theres something horrific about this record; its possessed by an indefinable evil that permeates every song.
	These songs display such moustache-twirling camp that they exert a lively pull despite the undead atmospherics. [Dec 2004, p.136]
