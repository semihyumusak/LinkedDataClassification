A lovely collection of Sunday morning melancholy that's as gentle as it is weary.
	Songs is heavy on romantic longing, but the music is so coy and smart that it rarely feels mushy.
	Represents a step forward. [Oct/Nov 2005, p.139]
	Rosie Thomas is just a little too ordinary.
	Thomas may have been perfect for a second- or third-tier Lilith Fair stage, a place where people expect slow, introspective, sweet songwriting. However, if she hopes to capture a larger audience, she may want to first capture herself a faster metronome.
	Lament after lament, they start to all blend together, and all of Thomas's considerable skill as a singer, musician, and composer can't seem to create any really arresting moments, just a lot of pretty songs.
	There's the potential for something here; as of If Songs Could Be Held, it's yet unrealized.
	A bland instrumental and production aesthetic... clips the wings off her good-intentioned melodies. [#11, p.113]
	Weak and vanilla.
