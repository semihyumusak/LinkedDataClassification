Breathtaking[ly] experimental.
	Lyrically lucid and sonically exciting. [11 Jun 2005, p.67]
	This is the finest debut hip-hop album I’ve seen since Aesop Rock’s.
	Kano's album is ridiculously good.
	Kano doesn't just defy the sonic tradition of grime on Home Sweet Home, he defies the tidy boxes MCs are usually plopped in upon their arrival.
	Kano has spent the last several years making “grime” records, but for better or worse, Home Sweet Home isn’t one of them.
	Home Sweet Home is refreshing and genuinely breathtaking.
	A great release from a great new talent, Kano has the words and the beats to deliver.
	Tough, yet with just enough tenderness. [Aug 2005, p.101]
	The kid is hugely talented-his flow is tight and, in a pleasant change from the Dizzee model, about 90% intelligible-but in trying so many different things he never quite succeeds at any of them, and so he comes off as a bit hollow.
	Establishes him not only as a master of the fast and fluid flow, but an insightful, frequently humorous - if somewhat socio- politically naïve - lyricist.
	The bulk of the album is pure Kano--deft wordplay and a range of musical reference points. [Jul 2005, p.115]
	An ungainly compromise blessed with a handful of skyscraping sonic highlights.
