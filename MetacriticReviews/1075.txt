Sale el Sol still demonstrates Shakira's boldly global mindset.
	Sale el Sol manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps you listening to the very end.
	Sale el Sol never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it's sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira's range and skill -- but listen closely and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does.
	The album isn't as heady as She Wolf, but there's an easy charm to how Shakira deftly navigates such a mash of genres.
	Mostly, her new album is businesslike, serious, sane.
