Sleater-Kinney... go for defiant uplift and seem energized by the challenge.
	S-K swagger like they never have before, eschewing the filler that made their last few records drag. [#9, p.157]
	An uncompromising, energetic monster of a record.
	For several albums now, Sleater-Kinney has shown eagerness to experiment, and it seems to be pounding at a wall, getting ever closer to the recording that will break it down. One Beat isn't quite it, but it makes a glorious noise in the process.
	One Beat joins the likes of Fugazi's In On the Killtaker and Bikini Kill's Reject All American for its impassioned new-world resistance, and could very well be the greatest triumph of punk independence since Black Flag.
	"One Beat" is so rich with strong new ideas that the dense disc actually takes some getting used to, a real accomplishment for a band some already view as an acquired taste.
	All of One Beat is strung loosely together by a common plea: for awareness, for understanding, and, most of all, for holding onto hope.
	The album retains the trademark layered sound of earlier work, the dueling guitars, the wailing vocals, the powerfully musical drumming, yet it plunges into much darker territory than before.
	One Beat is the Portland, Ore., trio's best work to date, illustrating yet again that women can play and will be heard, with or without a political platform.
	By taking the visceral punch of Dig Me Out and The Hot Rock, blending that with the pop sensibilities of All Hands on the Bad One, and throwing in a few bonuses, Sleater-Kinney have crafted their best album yet.
	There's lots for the lovers, plus some surprises that might win over a few haters. [23 Aug 2002, p.142]
	Their riotous manifesto remains the same, but their musical dialect has expanded to include blues, soul and even traces of pristine Led Zeppelin-era metal.
	One Beat's hooks require a few passes to take hold. [Sep 2002, p.127]
	One Beat is ruthless with SuperGlue riffs that reach back a decade or more, from the Go-Gos pogo of "Oh!" to the stuttering Cure guitars of "The Remainder" to the Buzzcocks toolings of "Hollywood Ending."
	Sometimes an attitude, a thumping beat and an A-plus scream like the one Carrie Brownstein provides here are really all that's needed. [Oct 2002, p.117]
	The group sometimes sacrifices immediacy for angular melodies and riffs that dont catch hold. On balance, though, One Beats musical progression is still extremely impressive.
	Bright, socially and emotionally engaged, justifiably righteous in places, and not quite the right sort of fun for the New York scenesters. [Oct 2002, p.104]
	There's no absence of strong material here, although the sequencing feels awkward. [Oct 2002, p.94]
	Few bands could explore motherhood and terrorism without making you want to shoot them: Corin Tucker's electric-shock voice and the adrenal guitars make them as essential pop topics as schoolyard crushes and backstreet drugs.
	One Beat is not an album you slip into. You pick it up, study it, twist it, put it down, pick it up again. [Sep 2002, p.108]
	The mixed results are troubling. [#55, p.86]
	Sleater-Kinneys weakest album in years.
