An extraordinary album. [Aug 2002, p.95]
	An oddity for sure, but much too good to be restricted to specialist alt-rock record retailers. [July 2002, p.122]
	Terrific stuff. [Aug 2002, p.122]
	An excellent and memorable album.
	Neither Modest Mouse Redux nor off-putting side-project indulgence, Sharpen Your Teeth is a small but effective stretch for a songwriter with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of great ideas.
	Cuts into raw indie rock with spells of country and folk, while allowing Brock to explore a varying scope of sounds.
	The collaborative nature of Sharpen Your Teeth, of course, yields a few missteps.... There are some damn fine moments here, though.
	The same studio experimentation that makes much of Ugly Casanova's music interesting also results in a handful of throwaway tracks enough to prevent Sharpen Your Teeth from becoming a wholly cohesive album.
	A just-okay collection of mellow ruminations that, at its best, recalls Tom Waits' Bone Machine, and, at its worst, sounds like indie rock's answer to James Taylor.
	If you take Sharpen Your Teeth as the superfluous wank-off side-project that it is, you wonÂ’t be as offended by its utter lack of imagination and artistry.
