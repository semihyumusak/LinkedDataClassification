Suffers from many of the same problems that tripped up its predecessor: too many skits, too few ideas and a voice that is neither hard nor particularly flowery.
	It's no better or worse than her 2002 debut or 2003's Chapter II, with the standout singles, decent album cuts, and filler fluff provided in equal doses.
	The album is hampered by needless skits and, at times, too slick production.
	An album of so-so hook[s] and vapid lyrics.
	A slew of mostly midtempo clunkers built with her weapons of choice: faux grit and forced sensuality. [24 Dec 2004, p.71]
	A lack of originality and too much filler mark Ashanti more as a pedestrian than the princess she purports to be.
	So this album contains Ashanti's best and most adventurous selection of beats so far. Unfortunately, it also contains the sketchiest and most irritating batch of songs. [13 Dec 2004]
	She still can't project any personality of her own. [27 Jan 2005, p.58]
	Monotonous in its R&B pleasantry. [Mar 2005, p.137]
	For all her lovesick panting, pleading and purring, Ashanti is never emotionally engaged with the songs, which aren't worth the trouble anyway. [2 Jan 2005]
