While retaining the melodic approach of his debut, the singer-guitarist has shaped some additional, more diverse sounds. [Dec 2012, p.88]
	If Let It Come Down was Iha's sun-dappled West Coast folk-rock break from the creative turmoil and personal squabbles of the Pumpkins, then Look to the Sky is his more austere, if no less captivating, look back from the sun and toward the dark moon of his alt-rock '90s past.
	[A] beautiful and calming record.
	Intriguing, but unsatisfying.
	'Look To The Sky' sees him returning to the spotlight with an album that only fleetingly hints at his past glories.
	He goes from pretty ditties to outright tedium as songs drag on interminably and eventually, unlistenably. [10 Nov 2012, p.53]
	Unfortunately, Iha's anemic vocals are as terminally starry-eyed as ever. [Dec 2012, p.107]
	Bafflingly outdated alt-rock songs that could comfortably sidle between choice cuts from Marcy Playground and Semisonic [circa 1998] and get their asses handed to them.
	Unfortunately all this hi-watt talent [guest vocalists] can't cover up Iha's weak vocals, which pass from winsome to wan early on and never recover. [No.92 p.54]
