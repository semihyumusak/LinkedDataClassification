A terrific and thoroughly enjoyable effort.
	The easy, carefree atmosphere is extremely effective; the songs’ warmth of proximity makes each better than it would be if heard alone, resulting in an album that somehow transcends its simplicity and becomes something of remarkable beauty.
	The Australian band's trademark winsome optimism, clever heartbreak and bittersweet cuteness are in classic form here, only lusher and more layered.
	The happy-music-with-sad-lyrics shtick has been done often, but rarely so well since the Lucksmiths' namesakes.
	Warmer Corners is like most Lucksmiths records; it's meant to be swallowed whole, and in an age of singles with albums attached to them, it's both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time.
	[They're] now on their eighth album and still finding something new under the pun. [Sep 2005, p.112]
	Only confirms the Belle And Sebastian comparisons this Australian band has endured throughout its seven-album career. [#69, p.100]
	It’s smart, depressing, inoffensive pop perfect for a rainy day.
	The Lucksmiths create art without artsiness and evoke emotion without melodrama.
	'Warmer Corners' is a timely reminder that the art of songwriting hasn't died - it just goes away and hibernates in the Adelaide Hills every so often.
	Does nothing wrong but could do with a bit of meat. [13 Aug 2005, p.58]
