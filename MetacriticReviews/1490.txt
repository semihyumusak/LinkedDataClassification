They create sophisticated and charming indie/pop songs that occasionally have moments of calamity and moodiness. Their hooks are compelling, their lyrics often thoughtful, and because they explore the topic of love and heartache, they're bound to resonate with many who give the intimate, Love Notes / Letter Bombs thirty minutes of their time.
	If Love Notes is their best album, it's because it's also their most emotionally conflicted.
	The Submarines are at their best when toying with charmed synth-pop.
	Sonically, it's the Submarines' most interesting record to date. Melodically, it's a bit spottier than usual, relying heavily on a handful of highlights to shoulder the weight of the saggier numbers.
	Unfortunately, as a whole, this record gets too monotonous during one sitting. It's just computer processor after computer processor, with a real instrument thrown in periodically.
