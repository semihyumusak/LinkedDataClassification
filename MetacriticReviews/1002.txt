Here's a group at the top of its game.
	Suitable for both the streets and chain stores. [9 Apr 2004, p.87]
	While Dilated Peoples doesn't throw many curveballs, when its fastball is working, it doesn't need them.
	Most of Neighborhood Watch is uncompromising proof that hip-hoppers, like rockers, can move units and still stay true. [May 2004, p.106]
	Three albums in, their belief that success and integrity dont have to be mutually exclusive, is finally starting to pay off.
	Their third album finds them immersed in light-hearted, yet imaginative hop n soul, Parliamentarian funk and the fiery chants of lead single This Way.
	Imaginative. [May 2004, p.101]
	Chunky, hook-laden songs like Tryin' to Breathe and This Way show a newfound sonic confidence, but Dilated Peoples remain astoundingly dull MCs, delivering earnest and predictable rhymes.
	The promising threesome spend most of their time in a creative rut, largely because of an unrelenting adherence to a diet of chunky beats and straightforward battle rhymes -- neither of which is particularly easy to digest.
	The album is plagued by too many predictable bass lines and uninspired samples. [May 2004, p.163]
	This sounds like a decent Gang Star LP--no bad thing, but it lacks the spark of individuality. [May 2004, p.103]
	All good, but not quite great. [Apr 2004, p.85]
	On Neighborhood Watch, their delivery is stale and unimpressive, much like the overproduced Expansion Team.
	Most of the blame for Neighborhood Watch has to go to the previously invincible Alchemist, whose productions are front-loaded on the record. Unfortunately, his beats aren't rugged or hooky, just astonishingly weak.
	They cant rap. Period.
	A waste of good beats.
	Evidence and Iriscience remain so humorlessly hard they could guard Buckingham Palace. [May 2004, p.108]
	Sounds for the most part weak and tired.
	Despite a few quality tracks, the album feels wholly uninventive and listless.
