An elegant masterpiece of unabashed Anglophilia, all slow-motion shoegazer guitars chiming like beautiful bells of doom and icy, disaffected vocals that sound like the Psych Furs' Richard Butler minus the three-packs-a-day larynx damage.
	Echoes of classic U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, and Swervedriver resonate throughout.
	Longwave aren't so much groundbreakers as they are purveyors of haunting, earnest pop. [Apr 2003, p.80]
	Bold, stirring and so unfashionable it just might work. [Mar 2003, p.114]
	Even in spite of their obvious knack for a beast of a tune that knows no indie fear, they do a cracking job of getting peculiar on us as well.
	A full three-fourths of the record feels more like the work of a band that hasn't yet staked out a sonic identity.
	A little blood and dirt and humor might have catapulted this album into greatness.
	Often dreamy, sometimes rockin', but rarely more than pedestrian.
	Though this music could easily be viewed as Longwave's take on Interpol's take on Coldplay's take on Radiohead, it isn't that derivative or boring.
	Where the big boys tick and twitch, Longwave merely plod. [Mar 2003, p.111]
	Taken on their own, tunes like "Pool Song" and "Tidal Wave" are hip songs to listen to while getting a tan. In the midst of a 12-song record though, they sink under the weight of their own drone.
	Longwave sound more British than Strokes-ish, with a mild talent for writing melodies that demand your attention. [Apr 2003, p.125]
	I just always felt comfortable in my thinking that one Toad The Wet Sprocket was more than enough to fulfill a specific emotional and intellectual niche. Am I wrong?
