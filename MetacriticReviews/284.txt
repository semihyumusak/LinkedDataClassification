	Those who embraced "Fallen" will doubtlessly fall even harder into "The Open Door."
	The best songs on The Open Door are the creepiest.
	No one is likely to describe Lee as "happy" - her music relies on an element of gloom - but she sounds confident and in control, and that gets Lee most of the way there.
	Fans will be thrilled to know that, despite the replacement of main guitarist and co-songwriter Ben Moody, Evanescence's sophomore album is at least as unsubtle as its predecessor.
