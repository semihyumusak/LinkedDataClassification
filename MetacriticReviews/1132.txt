Three Fact Fader is an impressive sophomore effort. Engineers have created a winning combination of English pop/rock.
	They've remarkably managed to raise the bar to a whole new level for an entire genre with Third Fact Fader. A triumph over adversity if ever there were one.
	The attention to detail where texture and colour is concerned is the crowning glory with the Engineers.
	If The Horrors' "Primary Colours" is the night out, then Three Fact Fader--Engineers’ follow-up to their 2005 debut--is the sound of the blissful recovery next day.
	The result is an album that’s catchier than the debut, even as it’s less obvious--one that keeps the uplift and reassurance of their past work while allowing more shades of other emotions (anger, fear, doubt, sadness) to add colour.
	Depending on how interested you still are by the record's third act, this can be either good or bad. It depends on your taste for disorientation.
	Regardless of whether or not the band lost whatever career momentum their debut generated, as a piece of music, Three Fact Fader fully delivers on the promise that was left hanging in the air for so long.
