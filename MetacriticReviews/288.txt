Amber Headlights has clear thematic and structural parallels to the Afghan Whigs' excellent 1996 rock opera Black Love.
	Amber Headlights fails, when it does, because it's trying to be two things at once: a personal reflection on life and death and a commercially acceptable rock record. But when the album ditches the tricks and conventions that define mainstream rock and focuses on Dulli's songs, it is very powerful indeed.
	For a fractured album that spent several years in limbo, Amber Headlights does two things very well: it's an impressive introduction to Dulli's far-reaching musical talent, and a spiritual cleansing for the wry vocalist himself.
	Amber sounds stock compared to either Twilight record, but Dulli's urgency, true to form, ensures that it's far from ordinary. [#11, p.110]
	The funk-noir backing means that Dulli is able to purr lyrics about "sexy ladies", debilitating cocaine habits and your standard-issue emotionally violent love affairs without sounding as trite as he perhaps should. [Mar 2006, p.104]
	Amber Headlights is neither a holy grail of unreleased Dulli tracks nor an insightful glimpse into the goings-ons behind his velvet curtain; nevertheless, it's by no means a major disappointment.
	Amber Headlights is a step backwards after the lush beats and subdued songs of the Twilight Singers' debut, 2000's Twilight, but it also seems weak following the harrowing Blackberry Belle and even the so-so covers album She Loves You.
	A disappointment.... While the voice still burns, the lacklustre songs cannot bear his weight.  [Apr 2006, p.113]
	As he points out in the sleeve notes, these were "works in progress", but that doesn't excuse using stagnant rock riffs to obscure his lack of inspiration.
