Cave In has always been a multifaceted band, but their stylistic range has never been as thoroughly explored as it is on White Silence.
	Generally speaking, though, White Silence finds Cave In at the heaviest point of their career since 1998's Until Your Heart Stops--and easily at their noisiest and most experimental.
	By turns melodic and thunderous, White Silence churns with 8-minute power dirges and soars with Beatles-esque hooks, making for an exhilarating musical rollercoaster that demands repeat spins.
	This is a grower not a shower but persevere because White Silence has been worth the wait.
	While Cave In's only constant to date has been change, the disc sums up everything that's made the band so beloved and bewildering over the years.
	Heavy and not consistently rewarding, it is nonetheless always interesting. [18 Jun 2011, p.51]
