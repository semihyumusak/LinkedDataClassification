A very fine record. [Feb 2003, p.86]
	Some rubbishy funk aside, Robinson sounds more energised than he has in ages. [Nov 2002, p.113]
	It's an old-fashioned record, feeling as if it was nearly 30 years old, even when it's informed by relatively recent funk, rock and jam bands.
	Robinson establishes himself as a distinctive singer, his world-weary yet optimistic drawl no longer beholden to the rock larynxes of yore. [#11, p.140]
	Instead of the Crowes' entertaining aping of the Faces and Bad Company, Robinson puts on a dreamy face and is just boring company. [25 Oct 2002, p.76]
	With too many half-baked songs, he ultimately comes off like a generic amalgam of a bunch of Seventies singer-songwriters.
	He sounds like a man lost amid his own vast record collection. [June 2003, p.109]
	Unfortunately, Robinson too often relies on shoddy -- if not overly elemental -- lyrical passages, which ultimately prevents New Earth Mud from lodging itself into your musical memory.
