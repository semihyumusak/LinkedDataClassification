Overall, "No Said Date" is the collective combination of stellar performances across the board.
	This is a return to the Wu sound; in-house production, more Clan cameos and less material dictated by current trends commercial.
	Masta Killa has delivered one the most urgent, straightforward Wu releases since the group's debut over a decade ago.
	His aggressive but nimble flow is all over each of these songs.
	Together, School and Silverbacks make the best Wu-Tang one-two punch that I can recall.
	An impressive album in the best tradition of the Clan... Had this album come out in 1998, people might have hailed it as another Wu classic.
