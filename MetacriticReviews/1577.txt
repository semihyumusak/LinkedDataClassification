This is a gloriously brave and vibrant piece of work and the most significant metal album of 2011 by some distance.
	While Unto The Locust has much within it that will appeal to unreconstructed customers, parts of this work showcase a unit whose creative appetites are still restless and free.
	For metalheads who like their music sharp and executed without recourse to compromise, then this is a contender for genre album of the year.
	Unto the Locust isn't just a great album, it's an important statement that metal doesn't have to fall into trite categories or draw from pre-existing formulas to be accessible.
	Unto the Locust does fall off a bit toward the end, but that's largely because the first four tracks add up to just under 30 minutes of the most exciting metal you'll hear all year.
	Machine Head is still a force in modern heavy metal.
