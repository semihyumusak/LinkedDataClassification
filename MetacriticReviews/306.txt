Twice as raw and thrice as hungry as anything the neo-soul mastermind has previously released, Hoping-from the title on down-is a full-throated, full-throttle challenge.
	Hunt has outdone himself, and it's possible he's just getting started.
	Hunt's refusal to be pigeonholed killed his major-label career, but without bean-counters looking over his shoulder, he sounds frisky and playful.
	He sometimes comes off a bit like he's exploring the idea of a genre more than actually writing a song ("Eyes Like Pearls" get dangerously close to Kravitzing) but generally has enough enthusiasm and hooks to make his celebration of musical freedom worth riding along with.
	This is a messy album, sometimes thrillingly so, a m√©lange of psychedelic rock, punk energy and R&B desperation.
	Hunt manages to turn in his most intense and provocative album yet, a stunning mix of prog, punk and soul that can challenge even the most jaded listener. [#81, p. 57]
