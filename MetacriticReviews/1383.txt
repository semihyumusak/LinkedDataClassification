It's enough of a reinvention to suggest that Britney will know what to do when the teen-pop phenomenon of 1999-2001 passes for good.
	A nicely varied, wholly satisfying collection.
	Britney and 'Britney' still works best when making a good pop cheese and dance sandwich.
	While she's been guilty of gluing sure-fire singles together with rotten fillers on her previous two albums, Britney uses this opportunity to take the odd risk and adds a welcome edge to her sound.
	While her normal source of junior raunch [Max Martin] churns out the usual fesity hits... the remaining chastity-endorsing mush is nowhere near as exciting. [Dec 2001, p.131]
	Many of the tunes are good for a romp around the kitchen (or the dance floor, if you prefer) but the girl is right when she says she is yet to come into her own both as a woman and a recording artist.
	It's hard to listen to the rest of Britney without imagining what the album would have sounded like had [the Neptunes] produced the whole thing. [#4, p.121]
	Britney is by far her most personable album, the most consistently playful and the least wince-inducing.
	Amazingly enough, she does sound almost human. [Jan 2002, p.108]
	Other than the absence of ellipses in the title, ''Britney'' finds pop's poster girl for virginal vamping in an awkward adolescence, wavering between playing it safe and busting a few tentative new moves.
	Most of the good parts of the Britney that originally hit us, baby, one more time (then oops!...did it again) drown in breathy vocals and multiproduced, tweaked-to-perfection studio gimmickry.
	Too much of Britney is dictated by Max Martin's teen-pop formula.
	An unmitigated drag.
