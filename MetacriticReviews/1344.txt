Where Subtle use many words to convey many things, I will use one: perfection.
	Intelligent, melodic, poetic and funny, so this is what Now sounds like eh?
	Doseâ€™s clever, rich, image-gorged writing is at that forefront more than ever, and, mercy, does he ever slam down the goods.
	Even more than their last record, the fine A New White, For Hero: For Fool is a wonderfully sprawling mess.
	The sextet take glitchy electronics, nerdy psychedelic rock and various forms of hip-hop to create a completely over-the-top concept album--and it works perfectly. [Dec 2006, p.208]
	For Hero: For Fool is a complete work from artists working at the top of their game.
	The chemistry has changed, the music is harder, the frustration's more palable, and you can hear that this is some kind of a make-or-break moment. And this time they made it-- just.
	It's almost like Subtle, as a collective, is afraid of letting loose or having too much fun. [Oct 2006, p.130]
	Part experimental rock, part electronica, and part hip-hop, Subtle's For Hero: For Fool is a complex, innovative, sometimes bizarre, and usually utterly confusing journey into the minds of lyricist Doseone and his five bandmates.
	Bewildered newcomers will soon be entranced, old fans won't be disappointed.
	Running over with ideas. [Nov 2006, p.128]
	Small problems aside, For Hero: For Fool is a worthwhile album.
	Absorbing. [Jan 2007, p.153]
	Subtle... build their hybrid from a quarter century of pop and college radio, then animate it with a megawatt jolt of race/class anxiety. [Dec 2006, p.100]
