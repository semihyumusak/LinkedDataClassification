Enjoyable stuff. [Feb 2012, p.81]
	Generally Moonfire is an album big on melody, heart and hooks.

	Moonfire is a perfectly nice album, one that would provide a suitable soundtrack to a warm, summer evening. However, if you're looking for something to captivate and engage you, then look elsewhere.
	Boy & Bear sound more like a personality-free replica of a radio-friendly sub-genre of the folk tradition, and fall way short of convincing us that they're the real deal.
	Their rootsy rattle'n'roll fails to connect with anything more grabbing than a vague lyrical nostalgia.
