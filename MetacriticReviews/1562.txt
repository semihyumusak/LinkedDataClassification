While his talent as a lyricist may leave something to be desired, you can't fault the guy for his dedication to putting a smile on the listener's face.
	The music, co-produced by Dave Stewart, plays up his jolly charm.
	The album relies equally on gleaming pop craftsmanship and on Mr. Starr’s charm, which are not always enough to redeem the more saccharine moments.
	Starr's songs have an old-friend quality, and their familiarity overshadows their hokier moments.
	Liverpool 8 is a relaxed, amiable collection of friendly pop tunes: it's nothing too flashy and it has no one tune that calls attention to itself, but it's a well-constructed, casually charming pop record.
	The need for peace and love animates Ringo's worldly concerns - four of the disc's dozen tracks mention "love" in the title - but they come across as little more than catchphrases aimed at the flower-power generation.
	Liverpool 8, which stands happily beside Starr's recent hits compilation, holds its own as a companion piece to McCartney's similarly vital "Memory Almost Full," and makes a nice day off from having to like Radiohead.
	If you can deal with the nostalgia factor, it’s a pleasant but unremarkable disc.
	He has nothing to prove. Yet, for those same reasons, the simplicity and humble warmth of Liverpool 8 are even more disarming.
	There are so many clashing vocal parts and guitar effects that you have to strain to hear the actual songs. Which is a shame, because said songs (all of which Ringo co-wrote) are pretty good.

	The major problems with his 14th solo studio album are Starr himself, and Dave Stewart. [Feb 2008, p.102]
