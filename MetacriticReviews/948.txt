So few men have managed to touch our scabrous hearts in such a way. Cohen, Bukowski, Barrymore, Hulk, Waterman... Middleton, Moffat.
	Monday is the greatest in a line of albums from a band that hopefuly has a few more years of screwing up and falling down on its itinerary. [#59, p.87]
	Monday at the Hug & Pint is Arab Strap's best record, and should land on every critic's 2003 top 10 list.
	May be one of their best. [#5, p.90]
	The least bullshitting, most accomplished and first consistently great release from Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton.
	The slight progression of the group here is discernible with a better understanding of balancing the musical peaks and troughs.
	Arab Strap successfully juxtaposes songs that deal with the fallacy of human interaction, while maintaining a singular Scottish sound and mindset.
	Singer-songwriter Moffat continues to showcase his unlovable-loser persona on the band's fifth set, but unlike on 2001's The Red Thread, he doesn't get bogged down in misery and despair: A wicked sense of humor and a more expansive musical palette help balance it out.
	Comeliness and brutal candour in equal measure. [Jun 2003, p.92]
	Has a pronounced acoustic bent. [May 2003, p.95]
	A set of apocalyptic relationship odes as pretty as an ornate church hymnal and as dour as the bleakest Sunday.
	Just as downtrodden and elegant as those [albums] before it. [1 May 2003, p.56]
	[Moffat's] monotone is offset by colorful arrangements. [May 2003, p.114]
	This might be the most varied record they've ever made.
	Musically more diverse, and lyrically as vulnerable as it is vitriolic. [Jun 2003, p.91]
	For every great line on the album, there are three throaway verses. [June 2003, p.96]
	All the restless energy adds up to a few too many diversions.
