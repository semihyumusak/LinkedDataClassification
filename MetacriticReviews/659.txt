Von Bohlen's thin vocals and a generally mushy sound keeps Glass Floor from catching hold at first, but Maritime's gently buzzing guitars give the songs a backbone that helps them stand up to multiple exposures.
	An unexpected treat.
	While not every song on Glass Floor is a gem, the best ones here are so good, I can only assume Maritime will be a step forward even for these artistsÂ’ illustrious careers.
	It mostly drives down that most scenic of romantic-pop roads, honking and waving at fellow motorists Death Cab For Cutie. [#64, p.104]
	Most of Maritime's debut feels incredibly boxed in. [Aug 2004, p.106]
	At times, these tracks strain to find a middle ground between pop stardom and thoughtful reverence.
	Plenty of albums split the difference between gems and junk, but the biggest problem with Glass House is that it lacks any discernible anima; the band seems to be phoning in their performance from a comfy armchair somewhere in Milwaukee.
	If there's any difference between this album and von Bohlen's lackluster recent output, it's that this collection somehow manages to be even more tepid.
