Much of Numbers feels melancholy-by-numbers, so melodies seem recycled, riffs feel tedious, and the emotional register dampens.
	What gives [Strength In Numbers]... the sound of a band landing its proper second stride is the hiss and grind that churns docile compositions into studio-kissed wonders. [Mar 2007, p.97]
	What makes Strength In Numbers interesting is the way it departs from the usual.
	For the most part, Calla has become an uncompromising version of themselves: melancholy, desperate, but above all, unable to break free.
	Calla's sound continues to evolve as they explore divergent musical avenues within the context of potent, atmospheric alt-rock.
	If they want to match the intensity of the singer's emotional performance, the band needs to loosen things up a bit.
	Calla deal in that dark romantic narcissism guys like Nick Cave and Tom Waits are known to wallow in on record after record.
	You could say Strength in Numbers is all bark and no bite, except there's not any bark either.
	Strength In Numbers makes you wonder if you ever really liked this band at all. [#75, p.94]
