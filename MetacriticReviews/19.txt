A sonic quantum leap. [Jul 2005, p.100]
	Stripped down, home cooked goodness. [Jul/Aug 2005, p.109]
	A splendid pop affair. [#10, p.116]
	[A] return to the simpler production style of 2001 debut The Optimist LP. [#68, p.112]
	All in all, this is a very impressive record, one that succeeds on just about every little tweak of the pop idiom it attempts.
	The arrangements are much tighter than ever and cover up whatever lyrical deficiencies the charismatic, freewheeling attitude of the band doesn't.
	Sweet, vibrant and sunny songs with just as much invention and passion as 2000's buzz-building early EPs.
	The overall feel of JackInABox is summery and light, and the album flows quickly and smoothly from song to song.
	In a sense Turin Brakes do little wrong on Jackinabox aside from the occasional gooey outbursts of gaiety.
	Though often pretty rather than memorable, there's enough vibrancy here to outlast the summer. [Jul 2005, p.90]
	JackInABox lacks the consistent flow of The Optimist LP and doesn’t match the sturdy songcraft of  Ether Song.
	Pleasant, but it's never particularly special. [Jul 2005, p.120]
	Turin Brakes’ expansive and more daring previous work held an encouraging arc that promised risks and excitement, but JackInABox, while a pleasant listen, fails to cash in on that potential, and is unfortunately a step back for the talented duo.
	There's a lot to admire on Jackinabox, although it's ultimately less than spectacular and even occasionally embarrassing.
	The likes of Road to Nowhere are Starsailor lite and suggest no great upturn in their fortunes.
	There’s not one song on here worth releasing as a single. Only two or three are even remotely listenable.
	For the discerning music listener, JackInABox is only bound to be a disappointment at best, and annoying at worst.
	Talk about a fall from grace. [4 Jun 2005, p.58]
