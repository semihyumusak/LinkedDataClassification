This music is the electronic, Warp-inspired answer to Brian Wilson's 'Smile.' [31 Jul 2004, p.41]
	An outstanding record which you'd be unwise to miss. [Aug 2004, p.91]
	An astoundingly accomplished collection of flawlessly interesting and compulsively beautiful songs. [#8, p.109]
	The disc alternates between unsettling, exhilarating, and devastating in its emotional impact; it's also difficult not to get distracted by everything going on musically.
	A band who aim foolishly high but always return, wings intact. [Sep 2004, p.92]
	A work of baroque detail, crossing between Mercury Rev's psychedelic Americana and The Beta Band's bucolic electronica. [Aug 2004, p.110]
	The Earlies are like a stripped-down take on the [Flaming] Lips: psychedelic, lo-fi and indie in the purest sense of the word.
	Given that it’s a collection of EPs and singles, These Were the Earlies is predictably all over the map, a problem exacerbated by the Earlies’ wide-ranging stylistic ambitions and long-distance collaborative methods.
	What's impressive is the way they bring all these elements together, the natural world leading seamlessly into a brighter landscape of surreal otherness.
	A deliriously ambitious record packed with neo-psych lullabies and swooning choruses.
	The album still holds together with a surprising cohesiveness, which is essential when crafting a debut that relies far more on the effect of its ambitious whole than any specific genre-bending tracks.
	A set of saccharine sweet songs which occasionally dissolve spectacularly in a haze of whirring electronic mist.
	As a headphone album, 'These Were... The Earlies' is something of a stunner.
	Imagin[e] the Beach Boys getting strung out in a field on cider midmorning in some alternative universe Texas, surrounded by retro-sounding DIY synths, a raggedy brass section, and a hippy cello player.
	It's not half-bad, providing you can get over the fact that the Earlies have yet to find a sound to call their own.
