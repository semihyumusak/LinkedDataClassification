Ever the brilliant craftsmen, Gene and Dean display a sharp eye for genre-specific details, offering just the right amounts of cheese and hooks (not to mention their trademark vulgarity) on splendidly stupid songs.
	As a summer stopgap for their new full-length this fall, Friends. works fine. The title track is quality, plus their fanbase eats this shit up.
	In the end this is a nice EP to play and a timely release considering the season and what they're releasing it right before.
	This record lacks a single guitar-driven rock song, instead spoofing saccharine dance-pop and exotic tropical genres.
	This canâ€™t be recommended for anyone but a pretty serious fan.
	The rest of this collection floats between funny and worthless, tending much more towards the latter by the EP's close.
	They seem to have packed up that cleverness with their Scotchgard bongs and headed straight for the wishy-washy world of adult contemporary without even knowing it.
