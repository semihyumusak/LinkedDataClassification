The band attempts to continue to deliver the hits on its seventh album, Splinter, while retaining its punk roots, and the Offspring succeeds on both counts.
	Throughout, Splinter's sound is powerful and dense, with The Offspring weaving and surging within it like the experts they've become. [Dec 2003, p.109]
	Taken seriously or not, Splinter holds together just fine.
	Only on "Prison Song," a jokey fake-oldie, does the Offspring's weakness for novelty tunes lead them astray. [Dec 2003, p.145]
	Sure, the Offspring packs a lot of punch, but you sorta find yourself wishing they'd give birth to a pure comedy CD just once. [12 Dec 2003, p.78]
	They're still pretty fly for old guys. [Jan 2004, p.97]
	A safe, calculated release. [Jan 2004, p.121]
	Granted, the Offspring have always dabbled in lyrical goofiness, but on Splinter, this approach seeps into the music as well. [Jan 2004, p.93]
	Crams every last piece of the Offspring puzzle -- slickly produced rock racket, hints of anti-establishment rabble-rousing, and reams of relationship and strip mall culture gaggery -- into its brief half-hour run time.
	It isn't that Splinter is such a bad disc per se, but more so that it is incredibly unsatisfying.
	The problem is that most of it is deadly dull.
