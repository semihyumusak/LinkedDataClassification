What sets the Fray apart is that they use their music to tell other people's stories in literate, compelling ways.
	Many of the dozen songs achieve the kind of meatiness that the group approached tentatively on The Fray.
	While they don't throw any curveballs or stir the pot too much, the band definitely stays true to their core, crafting yet another memorable piano pop-rock record with these stories.
	[Their] biggest, most-produced and boldest album yet.
	Scars & Stories may be nothing more than a pleasant retread of The Fray's established style, but it does a commendable job of delivering quality in lieu of novelty.
	A 12 song pop rock record aimed at pleasing your overzealous ex-girlfriend from college more than, say, the girl you finally deemed cool enough to settle down with.
	O'Brien helps them articulate their ideas, giving them definition and muscle, attributes that are appealing when the songs lack distinct hooks.
	Even producer Brendan O'Brien (Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young) can't save Scars & Stories from generic TV-soundtrack mediocrity.
	They're still pumping American-Coldplay ballads full of sky-groping choruses and symphonic rushes.
	Ultimately, these mid-tempo, mid-volume tunes flounder in mediocrity.
