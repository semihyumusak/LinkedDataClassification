Worthy of any superlative you can throw its way.
	Spartan and unadorned, the naked sincerity of the record is heartbreaking.
	A stunning debut and one of the best records of 2002.
	It would be a mistake to call the result "lo-fi": For all the songs' elemental ingredients, Beam is a gifted producer, imbuing The Creek Drank The Cradle with both breeziness and portent, subtlety and simplicity.
	[A] seemingly out-of-nowhere collection of quiet masterpieces.
	Though it is not overtly innovative in its instrumentation or approach, The Creek Drank the Cradle is composed and performed with such an inclusive, intimate voice that the album is extremely accessible, even personal.
	An astonishing debut.
	The Creek Drank the Cradle is made of small epiphanies.
	The ambiguity in the songs adds to their haunting quality.
	The Creek Drank the Cradle is very surreal, mythical, haunting; it creates a mood of warmth and comfort, and makes me feel as if I've been transported to another, far more peaceful plane of existence.
	Beam's evocation of elemental themes and dramas is too profound and affecting to deny. [Jan 2003, p.92]
	For a plodding, semi-mopey bit of understated blues, it's hard to beat.
	An album of quiet, introspective folk music.
	An acquired taste. [Mar 2003, p.109]
