A funky, soulful flashback to the works of outspoken jazz and R&B greats like Gil-Scott Heron and Miles Davis.
	Here the defining flow is sonic--a shadowy, guitar-drenched tone poem of the streets.
	The range on "The New Danger" is as broad and deep as the Brooklyn Renaissance itself.
	A grimier, more uncomfortable listen. [Nov 2004, p.100]
	Earthy, impressively diverse. [28 Oct 2004, p.101]
	The New Danger's pulse doesn't always support Mos' growing manhood. [#13, p.89]
	In a world where 50 Cent name-drops [Talib] Kweli, Mos Def wants to keep the line between indie hip-hop and major-label rap nice and blurry. [Oct 2004, p.112]
	He delivers for fans of every persuasion without losing grip on his ghetto past in the least--no easy feat. [Dec 2004, p.112]
	A breathtaking refresher in all things Mos Def.
	Not all of it works... but the 'What's Going On'-sampling 'Modern Marvel', mumbling folk-soul of 'Boogie Man Song' and widescreen shuffle of 'Champion Requiem' prove that not all hip-hop albums come with an expiry date. [23 Oct 2004, p.51]
	It’s largely half-baked in its execution.
	The New Danger is overambitious and undercooked, adventurous and bland all at once.
	Troublingly short on tunes.
	An experimental and melancholic set. [Dec 2004, p.157]
	A couple of creative notches below 2000's gleaming Black on Both Sides.
	This is the hip-hop equivalent of an all-stops pulled, Oscar-ready performance: mushily sentimental, self-righteously indignant and constantly in your face. [Nov 2004, p.138]
	A mishmash of mightily uneven demo-quality tracks. [29 Oct 2004, p.67]
	[A] disappointing release.
	Unfortunately, irrational moments like “The Rape Over” make you question the entire 17-track outing.
	Largely sounds like a drug-induced, incoherent jam session. [Dec 2004, p.215]
	Although Mos Def sometimes finds the casual groove he's looking for, this disc is surprisingly dreary and oddly abstract. [1 Nov 2004]
	A sprawling mess.
	When (and I mean, when) he raps, he's barely conscious.
	It features the same schizophrenic, influenced-by-everything quality of Dre's The Love Below, but where people were able to overlook the many boring-to-terrible tracks while skipping to "Hey Ya" or "Roses," The New Danger fails to feature as strong a centerpiece.
	The New Danger is as overextended as it is self-indulgent.
	It's not without its bright spots, yet it reaches dramatically but clumsily for the diversity and freshness of the first album, and comes up short.
	Mos Def's second solo album is not disastrous, but it's a sprawling, overambitious mess.
	A disappointment. [Nov 2004, p.124]
	A messy, disappointing record that would be a miss from any artist, but from an artist of Mos Def’s talents, it’s a minor disaster.
