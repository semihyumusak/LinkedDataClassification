Make no mistake about it, this is a formulaic album.
	L.L. still has a few tricks up his sleeve. [May 2006, p.135]
	In the end, even LL himself seems a little lost in his efforts to find Todd Smith.
	When LL teams with younger rappers... the album's momentum suffers. [23 Apr 2006]
	This is a serviceable, lighthearted album packed with R&B collaborations. [10 Apr 2006]
	Todd Smith's slow songs... kill the album's momentum early on.
	It's hard to find LL in the crowd. [Jun 2006, p.141]
	Too bad LL Cool J feels he needs the extra wattage, because Todd Smith's best moments come when he raps alone, letting his inimitably confident flow shine.
	The album doesn't really push the creative envelope and relies too heavily on guests at the expense of the principal artist. [15 Apr 2006]
	Todd Smith is glossy, safe, front-loaded, and slick.
	There's enough here to justify a listen, but with LL's considerable talents, a little more was expected.
	His 12th album is so girly it should be wearing pink tights and a tiara.
	Todd Smith might be the last straw for many fed up with his current direction.
	Actually, that's the vibe of the whole album: retro mid-90s LL.
	The static beats of... Scott Storch and Trackmasters do little to freshen up his sound. [Jun 2006, p.78]
	[Has] an uninspiring production line-up. [Jul 2006, p.101]
	Leav[es] one wondering whatever happened to the immortal MC whou could carry an album by himself without needing a breath. [4 May 2006, p.59]
