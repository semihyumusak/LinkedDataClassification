An unseemly, almost unnecessary foray into heavy metal and hard rock, especially in light of her success on the acoustic side.
	The music is occasionally difficult to embrace, to say the least...
	Messy, noisy, directionless, and painfully shy on both tunes and purpose... and winds up sounding a bit like a parody.
	Sadly sterile...
	Itâ€™s easily the weakest album in her career and sounds even worse when compared to the subtle path of Beautiful Creature.
