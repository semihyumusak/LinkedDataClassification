Be Still Please is another hidden treasure from one of the truly important bands, and persons, in pop music today.
	Oddly familiar but strikingly different.
	Be Still Please is the best work of McCaughan’s career.
	With Be Still Please... McCaughan weaves threads from all past Portastatic incarnations into one happy-sad tapestry.
	McCaughan's confidence, in his talents and his songs, is readily apparent throughout this album, and the result is his best non-Superchunk work to date.
	Unable to pen and record a clunker amidst his handsome ballads and cascading rockers, McCaughan coalesces sugar-coated melodies with personal, often uproarious lyrics that can make his 40-something voice sound half its age.
	Throughout Be Still Please, no matter how much it conforms to overarching indie stereotypes, McCaughan draws fresh delights at every turn.
	The extra focus on lyrics does seem to water down Portastatic’s traditionally instantaneous infectious hooks, sacrificing some style for substance and making the album a little more of a slow grower as opposed compared to those past. [#15]
	A compelling collision of listenable and clever. [Dec 2006, p.97]
	Be Still Please occasionally falls victim to over-orchestration. But McCaughan proves too much of an indie-rock veteran and pro to let that sink the entire album.
