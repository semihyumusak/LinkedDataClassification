The album sags toward the middle, but when he sticks to his strengths, Paul is arguably the ablest pop ambassador Jamaican music has ever had who isn't surnamed Marley.
	His first album in four years picks up exactly where The Trinity left off: at the centre of the dance floor.
	At 20 tracks long, Imperial Blaze suffers badly from a lack of editing, however, Paul also spends hald the album in ballad mode. [Nov 2009, p.111]
	Paul said in 2007 that his next disc would focus on youth violence in Jamaica, but there's little sign of that on the party-hearty Imperial Blaze, which is full of snazzy electro beats and tunes that sound like pale versions of past hits.
	Every single cliche held dear with the English language appears to have been right-click-Synonymed here.
	Some singles may work their way loose, but as a whole the album will is too long and monotonous; the affected style of Paul's voice, fine for the occasional single, becomes a grating trial over 21 songs.
	The audacity, the immaturity contained on Imperial Blaze is enough to hang a dark cloud over music, if only for an hour as the album lulls needlessly along....This is the worst album of 2009.
