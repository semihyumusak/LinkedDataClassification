From the onset, this disc excels on a new level.
	If Foreigner was still an active, young band, it would sound a lot like Matchbox Twenty.
	Matchbox Twenty now seem almost dignified, a fact that is as much a tribute to their advancing abilities as it is to how shamelessly their sellout successors suck.
	The songs lack hooks, as if melody would be too commercial, while the production has its sights on the radio, resulting in tuneless songs that are polished for mainstream consumption.
	A subpar album.
	Thomas's songs derive power from being derivative. [#13, p.98]
	Their songs aren't as good as their playing. [Apr 2003, p.98]
	Mostly it's too laboured to uplift. [Apr 2003, p.109]
	Thomas' lyrics are too frequently overwraught. [Mar 2003, p.98]
