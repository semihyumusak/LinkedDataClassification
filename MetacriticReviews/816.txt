Tropical Storm should be the album that blows away fans and critics alike.
	Storm is no Shaggy-style mall-reggae move; its beats and attitude are harder and more streetwise than Beenie's 2000 Art And Life. [Oct 2002, p.116]
	The smoothed-out international pop sound lets Beenie focus on doing what he does best -- making party music for party people.
	Don't discount the reggae portion of the program; with island impresario Tony Kelly involved in much of the album, songs like "Party Hard" and "Pure Pretty Gal" strongly affirm the tropical origins of this storm.
	His most commercial sounding material to date. [Nov 2002, p.106]
	All baes covered, an international hit seems guaranteed. [Oct 2002, p.100]
	A complex and rewarding exploration of the many musical and lyrical themes that tie contemporary reggae and hip-hop together.
	It's blatant commercial product, something for everyone.
	Superfine pop moments never stifle the underlying Jamaican flavor... even if Beenie sometimes sounds a bit like a guest on his own album. [#10, p.114]
	Only the thickly gnarled riddims of the Sly-and-Robbie-produced "You Babe" really sets your ass to swaying -- and in the process, that song underscores just what a weak Storm this really is.
