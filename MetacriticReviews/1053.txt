[Fall Heads Roll] is of head-turning quality.
	'Fall Heads Roll' as a whole might not quite scale the heights of 'The Real New Fall LP', but there's no doubt that elements of it are up there with it.
	Overall, a handful of great songs, no clunkers, and one absolute classic is more than should be expected of any album.
	The Fall are actually at their most settled, stable and plain rocking in years. [1 Oct 2005, p.47]
	Fall Heads Roll sounds more like the work of an emerging artist than it does an established band catering to a core audience.
	The arrangements pound and lurch through acrid garage-punk riffs with crazy sureness. [Dec 2005, p.145]
	Equitable with the Fall's bossiest, most brazen moments. [#70, p.94]
	A grab-bag of a Fall album with brilliant highs and scattered lows.
	If there's a method to this madness, you definitely won't find it here. [Nov 2005, p.101]
	Yes, the album stretches itself a little thin towards the end and some of Smithâ€™s slurred lyrics are truly unintelligible, but essentially this record is joyously, thankfully, inexplicably, after all these years, still the sound of the Fall.
	If you hack off the misguided finish, Fall Heads Roll proves they can still live up to their legend.
	[Smith's] curiously magical songwriting skills... remain undimmed by time and drink. [Nov 2005, p.124]
	Contains the usual assortment of slurred tirades and workmanlike riffs, but it also features a smattering of minor Smith classics. [Nov 2005, p.96]
	Serves notice the band isn't going away anytime soon. [#11, p.106]
	Proves Mark E. Smith's gang have lost nothing of the power to surprise. [Nov 2005, p.104]
