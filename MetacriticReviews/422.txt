An elegant summation of his work. [11 Aug 2006, p.69]
	All we need to know is, he was a master and this is his masterwork.
	This is an African classic.
	Savane stands out both as Ali Farka Touré’s masterpiece, and as one of contemporary African music’s finest achievements to date.
	His unsentimental, voluptuously masculine, spirit-guided magic is captured at its best, for all time, in this magnificent farewell.
	"Savane" is without question one of the finest efforts in his legendary discography.
	One of his most accomplished recordings.
	It is beautiful, emotive music, literally and figuratively entrancing.
	This final record shows Touré still brimming with vitality. Savane is his wonderful farewell gift.
	Probably the most gutsy, timeless recording of his career. [5 Aug 2006, p.29]
	A work that deserves every bit of praise that it receives. [#15]
