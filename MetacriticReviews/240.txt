There's nothing complicated on this album, but then when did things ever need to be complicated?
	As the group replaces departing guitarist (and founding member) Dave Dederer with Andrew McKeag, while they bring Seattle underground mainstay Kurt Bloch in as producer, all elements that help make These Are the Good Times People perhaps their most eclectic album to date.
	While not as immediately memorable as "Lump" or "Peaches," punchy songs like album opener "Mixed Up S.O.B.," "More Bad Times" and the breezy "Loose Balloon" come across as less novelty-like as a result of songcraft.
	There's nothing essential here, but there's nothing to dislike either. [Apr 2008, p.115]
	Spiky-sounding pop dominates with abrupt or obtuse song titles the rule not the exception. [Apr 2008, p.110]
	The Presidents found on These Are the Good Times People are officially lame ducks, serving out their term while rock music elects a new Chief Executive.
	These Are The Good Times People is a mere shadow of its ‘90s counterpart that struggles to retain any of the President’s early charm.
	This is surely the desperate death-thore of a rank '90s relic. [Apr 2008, p.99]
