Unfortunately, Arthur drags his backing players through a good deal of hoarsely hollered filler between [the] peaks. [20 Apr 2007, p.62]
	Some more outré passages could have benefited from mad-scientist tinkering. But the mad-Mick Jagger that Arthur affects on the nasty "Cocaine Feet" and elsewhere is still nicely twisted.
	A chaotic mix of gorgeous T. Rex acoustic reveries, cheeky Stones-inflected rockers and studio-jam goofiness. [Apr 2007, p.55]
	There are fewer memorable moments here than on his solo albums, but it's still nice to hear him taking risks. [21 Apr 2007]
	A diverse collection that often has a life force all its own. [Jun 2007, p.150]
	Let’s Just Be is as poppy and willfully idiosyncratic as Arthur’s older work, but is both more conventionally arranged and more loose-limbed than ever before.
	A sweaty, first-take orgy that sometimes suggests Tom Waits fronting the Stones, only clumsier. [May 2007, p.84]
	There's an air of sloppy experimentation, of demos and B-sides and other things that probably won't interest more than the heartiest fan.
	A wildly uneven record.
	There are a few quality tracks among these 16-- enough for a pretty good EP-- but this is an 80-minute album with at least an hour of stuff on it that sounds at best like studio outtakes.
