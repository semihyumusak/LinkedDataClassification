Is not only utterly delectable but manages to find genuinely new ways to shape heartbreak. [Dec 2002, p.114]
	Hayden has released an album of magnificent proportions.
	Although its best moments don't reach quite the altitudes of his prior releases, Skyscraper National Park, as a whole, is the most complete and coherent album in Hayden's catalog, a delightful listen from track one through track eleven.
	An album that is both emotionally powerful and truly beautiful.
	Skyscraper National Park is an amazing record that tells its entire story with a hushed voice and subdued instrumentation, but is still more affecting then being screamed at for hours on end.
	Delicate slices of low heart-rate brilliance.
	If Low or Acetone pull your melancholy levers and there's a need for some hurt feelings, then go ahead and reserve Skyscraper National Park a space on your 2002 top-10 list. [#54, p.92]
	Enjoyable rather than revelatory, and quirky rather than profound.
	Hayden draws from the traditions of eccentric folk-rock, but his ragged, harrowing concoction of acoustic gentility and electric anarchy stands as a genre all its own.
	After a couple plays, his just-crawled-out-of-bed falsetto and homemade designs start taking root. [Nov 2002, p.102]
