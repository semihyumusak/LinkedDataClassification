Carried by his gruff voice, Foundling's all warm arrangements and real emotion.
	The sense of abandonment hinted in the title of David Gray's second album in less than a year, Foundling, could be a reference to the work's minimalist nature.
	If this release is David Gray's self-loathing moment of pure, unabashed misery, that's OK. Besides, where would all of that appeal go if he ever decided to get happy?
	Bare bones it may be, but it's still recognizably David Gray. [Sept. 2010, p. 102]
	Foundling sounds as if Gray is alone with his guitar in the wee hours, whispering into a handy microphone. But if we've heard it all before, it doesn't mean Foundling isn't high-quality adult-pop.
	This album may be out of time, often boring, but is just too competent to lend itself to any fun.
	David Gray doesn't really purport to be anything other than a contemporary folk-pop singer, and Foundling finds him doing what he does best.
	It's a promising start from a guy whose tastefulness too often trumps the spirit of experimentation that distinguishes him from his soft-rock peers.
	He's getting more interesting with each release. [Sept. 2010, p. 116]
	The songs are pretty, well-written and well-constructed, but the album as a whole lacks the vitality that would give it necessary variety.
	Indeed, at some worrying points, Gray sounds like he's on the point of expiring, so croaky and listless is his voice.
	Gray tries to bring some color to the album with his terrific, weathered tenor, but there's only so much he can do in performing material this staid.
