This is one of those rare albums that makes you wonder how you ever got by without it.
	From Here We Go Sublime may not be an evolution for Willner, but it’s a singular distillation of his talents into one album. Mixing gauzy shoegaze, slippery ambient loops, and two-cheeks-on-the-floor bass drum bounce, the Field offers an idyllic work of startling novelty, and perhaps ‘techno’’s most widely appreciable offering in years.
	From Here We Go Sublime is fantastic all around, and it’s all the more effective for its restraint.
	It focuses on the epic qualities of Ride and MBV, combined with Wilner’s cosmic pop chops and his predilection for shuffly techno grooves.
	If Willner doesn't hit at least some of your pleasure centers, well, forget your ears-- your nerve endings might actually be dead. Even three months in, it's a safe bet that From Here We Go Sublime will wind up 2007's most luxuriant record.
	It’s fair to say if you don’t find anything worthwhile somewhere in this record, you probably just don’t enjoy electronic music.
	It feels endless — in a good way.
	If you like minimal electronic music at all, you must seek it out.
	It may sound simple but it's devastatingly effective.
	Mesmerising stuff. [Jun 2007, p.99]
	An electronic album that is utterly original and not easily forgotten.
	Wilner’s talent lies in revealing the abundance of music locked inside even the smallest fractions of extant recordings.
	This is an album you could easily hate -- especially if you like things like change and development.
	Track for track, From Here We Go Sublime is mired in some of the simplest beats in modern electronic music.
