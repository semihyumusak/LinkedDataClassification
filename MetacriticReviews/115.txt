Whether or not you can get with Malin's other records is immaterial; this one should be embraced by anyone who loves rock & roll.
	For the Malin faithful, these are the seeds from which the glitter in the gutter sprung. [Nov 2008, p.129]
	Solid and stolid live album from glam punker turned roots rocker.
	Odds and sods, then, but not without appeal. [Jan 2008, p.101]
	On Your Sleeve acts only as a fine stopgap until Malinâ€™s next release proper. This late October disc still plays as more treat than trick for his loyal fanbase.
	There are some highlights--an electro update of the Stones' 'Sway' and a sweet harmony-laden take on Neil Young's 'Looking for a Love'--but other tunes feel too heavy for Malin's reedy voice.
	An album as close to a dictionary-standard definition of the word mediocre as there is likely to be in the whole of 2008.
	Rather than offering reinterpretation, Malin sounds like an annoying guest at a house party, who despite all efforts to hide the guitar has found it and insists on playing a disparate bunch of songs much to the annoyance of everyone else, none of whom quite have the heart to tell him to stop.
