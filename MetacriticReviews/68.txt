There's not a weak moment on this dark-horse gem of a disc.
	Wardâ€™s controlled voice never falters or fails, which makes his words of wisdom drill into the soul with unquestionable power.
	This is a dark night of the soul record, a distant country cousin of Young's Tonight's The Night, but it feels flooded with light and air and space. [#232, p.73]
	As familiar as alt-country has become, Ward makes it worthwhile again. [#16, p.125]
	Ward creates a full, alluring atmosphere that will recall for listeners all sorts of classic American music, real, remembered and imagined.
	Frustratingly short of utter genius, but largely lovely too. [May 2003, p.102]
	Transfiguration is a quiet record and might lose some listeners in it's sleepy summer melancholy, but M. Ward is the real deal.
	at you have here is the exact opposite of a period piece: it's new but it feels old, it's here but it's nowhere, it's now but it's forever. Whatever, wherever, and whenever it is, though, it's lovely.
	A rich quilt of Americana, as if the folk, country and rock strands were brought together in a starlit saloon somewhere near the border. [Jun 2003, p.106]
	Another masterclass in deft guitar picking, smudged with piano, harmonica and a voice like honey drizzled onto a dry creekbed. [Jun 2003, p.93]
	Ward's far-ranging sound transcends the room.... If only his lyrics were as fresh. [#58, p.106]
	M. Ward's creations have the fragility of drawings made in the dust that's settled on a china cabinet. [Apr 2003, p.87]
	Ward injects a welcome dose of melody and sonic adventurism into the sagging lo-fi singer/songwriter genre. [#5, p.108]
