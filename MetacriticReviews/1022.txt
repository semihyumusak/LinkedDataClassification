Gone is the Suede-lite of The Tears. Instead we get acoustic guitars, lush string arrangements and the previously cagey Anderson pouring his heart out. [Apr 2007, p.92]
	What makes Brett Anderson succeed as solo debut is that it truly presents Anderson on his own, willing to sound different, quieter than he did when in a band, willing to open his heart without regard for consequences.
	A near-perfect debut. [#17, p.82]
	Neither tearaway maverick nor irrelevant abdicator, Brett Anderson sounds like a man out of time in a time out of joint. No bad thing, necessarily.
	Dubious lyrics notwithstanding, this is exactly the kind of album that a formerly drug-addled, ludicrously randy, city-dazzled English suburban boy ought to be making when he reaches the onset of middle age.
	There's a fair bit of self-indulgence here, but the former Suede leader has a way with these things, and the result is generally listenable.
	His lyrics don't always match his ambition. [Apr 2007, p.108]
	11 tracks of the same old maudlin balladry.
	Shorn of his camp finery, not to mention his preferred subject matter - androgynous boys from suburbia kissing under nuclear skies - his voice, still an acquired taste, proves ill-suited to introspection.
	On his lonesome Anderson is oppressively unimaginative.
	This is hollow, pretentious and deeply dull music. [Apr 2007, p.116]
