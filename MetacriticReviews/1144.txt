Never Gone [is] a solid adult contemporary album, which will please both BSB diehards and the dwindling ranks who wish that the glory days of Jon Secada never ended, but its relative strength does highlight one problem with the album: this kind of music doesn't sound quite as convincing when delivered by a group of guys as it does by one singer.
	Even if they aren't Never Gone, their inspiration certainly is.
	This corny comeback is hardly a triumphant return. [24 Jun 2005, p.165]
	Lest you doubted it, this is grotesque.
	Never Gone's rock ballads are painfully and sometimes powerfully earnest demands for meaning and redemption. [Aug 2005, p.108]
	What stops the Backstreet Boys from being any fun is, I think, their inability/refusal to wink at their audience.
	The Backstreet men rarely accelerate beyond a mid-tempo thud. [16 Jun 2005, p.100]
