Keep an ear open for this solid effort's best moments: the soulful "Full Frontal Fridays" and jubilant "I Get Cravings."
	Sensual, mysterious, and provocative, Learning From Falling shines brightly.
	Locates her coffee-cream vocals amid glossy settings ranging from hip hop to gurgling electronica and folk. [Nov 2002, p.105]
	The sitar flourishes ini "Splitting Atoms" are muted by Learning's adult sheen, which lands this unusual record in an awkward middle ground between Bjork and, say, Oleta Adams. [#9, p.150]
	The album as a whole isn't quite as brilliant as it ought to be, given the ideas at play.
	You're left pining for more of her delicious weirdness, more sitar solos, more of her trombone playing and Swahili lyrics.
	Many songs on Learning From Falling have that vaguely edgy, vaguely happy, vaguely cutesy sound often heard piping from the speakers at Wal-Mart, and soon it becomes clear she's making the same vocal choices on song after song.
