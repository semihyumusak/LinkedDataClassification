Williams' captivating lyrics are gut-wrenchingly intimate.
	It's the most extraordinary smorgasbord of styles, moods, modes, a far more daring, jolting record than 2001's Essence. [Album of the Month, May 2003, p.88]
	A perfectly imperfect set, it's looser, blowsier, and more what-the-hell? than anything she's done.
	It is all heart, it is truth and it is beautiful. [Jun 2003, p.94]
	While Essence was lyrically spare, World marks Williams' return to the painful sensuality of the specific. [May 2003, p.109]
	World Without Tears is a complex, multifaceted album that musically highlights Williams's continued blurring of musical genres and poetic lyrics.
	A band record, a groove record, a riff record; something lowdown, dirty, smoky.
	World Without Tears... is the singer-songwriter's rawest album to date -- it's often closer to all-out rock than it is to either alt-country or the singer-songwriter tradition -- and it's also her best release so far.
	She is simply magnificent.
	It is simply the bravest, most emotionally wrenching record she's ever issued.
	There's more Patti Smith in her than there is Patsy Cline.
	It's an album filled with appetites and their consequences.
	She sounds gloriously rough-edged and authentic. [May 2003, p.114]
	Unlike 2001's spare Essence, this album prickles with the lyrical details that make Williams's work exceptional. [#15, p.126]
	Williams continues taking chances, lyrically and stylistically, but with a success rate that would only be acceptable of someone with less songwriting talent.
	She remains utterly, excessively self-involved.
	Musically, it's as superb as anything she's ever done.... But underneath the sublime sounds, something crucial is missing.
	Beyond the musical unevenness of an album whose finer qualities interleave those mounting miscalculations, a rising suspicion that misery is of more comfort to her than happiness makes the tenor of Williams' songs increasingly hard to bear.
