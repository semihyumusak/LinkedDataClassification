And though the album sags a little towards the end, with a few shorter instrumental numbers, it’s still an invigorating journey, a caravan of cavorting musicians, careening through the countryside, stopping only to play festivals and funerals.
	Another stellar song collection.
	Vivid, diverse and faintly trippy. [Nov 2006, p.99]
	Barnes' accordion playing has grown leaps and bounds since Noon.
	A set glorying in its sensual exoticism. [Jan 2007, p.102]
	If you liked Beirut, you’ll love this.
	A curious, klezmer-infested charm.
	The potency of AHAAH's genres of choice are both the album’s difficulty and strength; if you aren’t partial to Balkan brass, klezmer or mariachi, abandon all hope of sticking this one out.
	An oddly affecting collage. [Dec 2006, p.132]
	Bleak and evocative.
	This is his best yet. [#15]
