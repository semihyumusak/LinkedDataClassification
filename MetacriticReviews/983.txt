Given what a satisfying collection In Living Cover manages to be for the most part, it’s a shame that he chose to end on a couple of bum notes.
	This album ultimately emerges as an erratic project, its highlights spread too thinly to do much good.
	Jay Brannan means well on his first collection of cover songs. Problem is, he doesn’t bring much of himself to the proceedings on In Living Cover, aside from a dead-serious delivery set against a spare folk backdrop.
	Most of the album's remaining tracks are utterly vacuous interpretations of songs that few are likely to care much about. They offer nothing new to anyone or anything.
