Remind Me Where the Light Is ultimately concludes as the luminous successor to "Trading Twilight for Daylight"--bright where that album was nocturnal, open-armed where "Twilight" was introspective, and altogether illustrative of Great Northern's growth as songwriters and performers.
	This is an album that’s extremely clean--the spic-and-span sonics might be the work of producer Michael Patterson. Even if it might help Great Northern achieve some broader success, all that cleansing has buffed away much of the band’s character.
	Unfortunately, the newfound confidence doesn't extend to lyrics rife with nonspecific, mixed-metaphorical angst that smacks of the overwrought youth demo they've otherwise outgrown.
	It feels a lot longer than it is, and that's a bad thing. [May 2009, p.115]
	Great Northern may not have learned the art of being musically economical, but perhaps their greatest strength lies in their maximalist tendencies.
	Remind Me ... has the feel of two albums compressed into one, and a slightly more minimal approach to instrumentation would have given some of the slower numbers added gravitas.
	The band's music is spot-on for soundtrack work precisely because it's moody yet unobtrusive, evocative of something, yet noncommittal enough to conceivably fit any emotional tableaux.
	The album’s cleanly produced and confidently performed, and the material has been polished up until it shines brightly at first. But a few repetitions quickly drain Remind Me Where the Light Is of much of its impact.
	The production on their sophomore effort, Remind Me Where the Light Is, is both a blessing and a curse, inflating some effects to dazzling prominence while pushing a host of crummy, outdated ideas to the forefront.
	Much of the songwriting presented here also feels fairly stock. [Spring 2009, p.66]
