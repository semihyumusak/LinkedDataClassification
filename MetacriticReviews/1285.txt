[A] finely honed collection. [29 Jun 2007, p.136]
	There's a real person writing and singing these songs, with a lifetime's worth of joys and disappointments, as well as the wisdom to keep it all in proper balance.
	[It] sidles forth with an easy-going aura, belying the artistry within. [Jul 2007, p.107]
	Lowe pulls it all together with warmth, wit and searing emotional honesty.
	A soul-drenched, horn-inflected labor of lust. [Jul 2007, p.100]
	The album traverses Ray Charles-like country soul, smoky late-night jazz, lush Western swing, and even a bit of Rockpile-style rockabilly.
	It takes time to make music as effortless and elegant as this, to construct songs this finely detailed.
	[Lowe] keeps it terrifically mellow without getting mushy in the head.
	Probably his most personally revealing work yet.
	At a mere 33 minutes, "At My Age" leaves listeners wanting more, but then, that seems to be part of Lowe's seduction technique.
	The lyrical chops are intact but the production is far too dated.
