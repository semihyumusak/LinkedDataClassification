An album that breaks little new ground, but further entrenches the Method as America's finest producers of dance music made for rock & roll people.
	A mind-twisting collision of rock, techno and hip-hop.
	To Jordan and Kirkland's credit, they let their guest stars shine without sacrificing the Crystal Method sound. [18 Jan 2004]
	Too many tracks get bogged down with a straight-ahead progressive trance formula, where zoning out feels more suitable than attempting to move your feet. Still, because the good stuff is so darn good (and it is), it is easy to brush aside any missteps.
	Masterfully crafted and shot through with outlaw energy. [May 2004, p.101]
	A somewhat dated listening experience.
	Legion of Boom is more like the soundtrack to a horror movie than a night of DJ breaks and body shakes. [Feb 2004, p.102]
	There are too few surprises amid the usual, admittedly fun, rocktronic rave-ups.
	The Crystal brothers score low on originality, but they certainly know how to make cheaply pleasurable noise.
	[Their] big beats lack the sure-shot hooks of their 1997 debut. [Feb 2004, p.104]
	Resembles nothing more than a U.S. major label executives idea of what dance music should sound like.
	TCM has become utterly irrelevant. [Feb 2004, p.78]
	As full of empty bluster as its title. [Mar 2004, p.110]
	The problem is not the lumbering, mid-tempo beats or the terrible lyrics (Synthesizer, crystallizer, realizer), although neither help. Its the sense that youve heard every synthesized squelch and ambient breakdown before.
