Although their name might seem like a stretch when requesting at your local record store, this album is worth a purchase.
	Reintegration Time‘s alright, but it’s no substitute for seeing these guys perform.
	It all adds up to a good but frustrating album of really solid highs and really annoying lows.
	They have the formula down, but 10 tracks of this gets a little tedious.
	Reintegration Time is a neat, reserved album, if not satisfying as a close approximation of the band's live sound, then as a more low-key exploration on a parallel path.
	On cuts like "How Do I Maintain Pt. 1," the rhythmic interplay gets weighed down by its own excess, but the more expansive clouds of synth exhaust in wordless bookends "Run" and "Reintegration Time" offer more rewarding highs.
	The heavy-handed force of the latest effort to sonically disconstruct and reconstruct gets tiresome. [Spring 2009, p.103]
	Reintegration Time, the second album by Canada’s Shout Out Out Out Out, is ambitiously laid out, with lengthy, mostly instrumental tracks and a leisurely sense of pace. Too bad the electro grooves don’t offer much, nor does the ornamentation.
	They're fine when doing the burbling, instrumental stuff, only to lose marks for a couple duff guest vocals and over-reliance on vocoders. [Jun 2010, p.132]
