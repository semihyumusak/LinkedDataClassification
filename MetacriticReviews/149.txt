Teamed with new producer Chris Lindsey and with more time to create than she did in the rush following her run on "American Idol," Kellie Pickler's second album is another solid step toward country stardom.
	There are individual moments of accomplishment, but the album is like a Whitman Sampler, with a sweet tidbit for listeners in pretty much any stage of a romantic relationship, leading to a fairly scattered emotional palette.
	"If those girls were being honest and have been where you’re at. I bet they tell you they wish they had their innocence back." But this is what passes for wisdom on Ms. Pickler’s tepid and forgettable new record.
	They chuck all that out the window by corseting her cornball humor into an immaculately tailored straitjacket, burying her voice in the mix, cutting away the country in favor of a manicured crossover pop unsuited for Pickler's gawky, gangly voice.
	Kellie Pickler is rote, overproduced Nashville pop-country, while Kellie Pickler is too forceful a personality to be reigned in by such convention
