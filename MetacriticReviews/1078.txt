	Whatever subtlety Germano's voice and lyrics might lack is buttressed by the deceptive simplicity of her music.
	There's less of the wry humor Germano usually allows to shine through once in a while... This is also her least gauzy-sounding album since Slide... Despite these differences, In the Maybe World is still a strong addition to her body of work.
	In The Maybe World is an accessible, if lyrically opaque, work that should please fans of avant-pop that doesn't sound remotely like any of the other cerebral chanteuses out there.
	Germano's wooziest and most ethereal [album] yet. [Aug 2006, p.78]
	In the Maybe World feels like an (unintentional, perhaps) sequel or response to Geek the Girl, turning down the intensity while sharing a twilit mood.
	The balancing of ironic humour that raised a smile on earlier albums is absent here, which leaves us with almost nowhere to hide.
	Ms. Germano’s music is beautifully haunted and composed, but almost too claustrophobic to bear. [17 Jul 2006]
	Wield[s] both a wistful poignancy and raw emotional undertow. [Aug 2006, p.94]
	The overall effect is too solipsistic and immature to take you close to the title's imaginative world. [Aug 2006, p.96]
	The problem is, it’s easy to lose the lyrics when the music gives us no reason to listen to them.
