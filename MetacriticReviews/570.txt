There is a carefree feeling to Haywire that’s infectious, that makes the album’s ordinariness not matter.
	He's devoted to ?traditional arrangements, and he's packed this fourth album, Haywire, with steel guitar, fiddles, and two-stepping beats. But not far beyond the ?delights of the first single, "Why Don't We Just Dance," Haywire gets bogged down by increasingly hokey love songs.
	While Turner is a worthy heir to such barrel-chested baritones as Don Williams, Randy Travis and Trace Adkins, his fourth album, "Haywire," is a study in inconsistent use of his vocal gift.
	Haywire is pure vanilla, pleasant enough but not adding anything of note to Turner's catalogue beyond a couple of new singles for his eventual greatest-hits anthology.
	Everybody’s got to miss sometime, and on Haywire, Turner does by a mile, despite his no doubt good intentions in taking some of the slickness off the contemporary country sound.
