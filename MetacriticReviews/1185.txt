He sticks defiantly to formula, hustling a string of synth-heavy, syncopated club jams. [#14, p.134]
	Street Dreams is a little too padded for its own good, and a handful of tracks suffer from all-too-familiar samples that have been used in recent hits by other artists.
	His laid-back delivery and glitchy computer beats are only interesting for so long.
	There is little truly distinctive here. [Jun 2003, p.113]
	The F.A.B.O.s smooth, deadpan flow cruises over benignly commercial beats, and the overall effect isnt hard enough to stand up to "official" street-issue hip-hop.
	It's raised a notch by the seductive combination of just-grimy-enough production and smooth vocals. [Jun 2003, p.96]
	Five decent tracks (only three new) does not make a good album, and that is why Street Dreams only improves on Fabolous debut marginally.
	The productions are much better than the songs.
	Dull missteps such as "Sickalicious" and "Into You" show a lack of creative vision that stunts him when the hot beats run dry.
	Street Dreams reveals itself as a hollow gem when Fabolous tries to have it all, unveiling a gangsta sneer so unconvincing it makes Nelly seem dangerous.
	While a delight on guest appearances, he has yet to prove that he can construct memorable songs, let alone a solid album.
	Most tracks trade impact for cheesy hooks, skittery beats, and rudimentary keyboard riffs that can't help but evoke that jiggly seizure-type shit Puffy's dancers were big into a few years back.
	The ideas are thin and the beats thinner. [14 Mar 2003, p.66]
