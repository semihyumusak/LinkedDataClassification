The quirky murmurs, yelps, and coos of his head voice, a high end of unequalled softness and give, sound responsive where Jackson's sound willed. There's a girl there, or just as likely a grown woman. And whether or not El seems manly to you, he's turning her on and vice versa.
	It's the year's most elegant tell-all.
	While the material on Second Chance is quite straight forward and not very new, the album works, because it's a comfortable move forward for an artist who is trying to make up for lost time. The album is a defining second chance.
	The album succeeds to a large extent simply because it addresses a wide demographic. He sings several steamy love songs whose urban fire will ignite those in search of R&B style passion.
	While the first ten songs would have made for a strong return on their own, the final three put Second Chance over the top as one of the year's best R&B albums.
	Like a lot of current R&B, there is a sense of anonymity in some of the tracks. Any one of the above singers [James "Jimmy Jam" Harris, Terry Lewis, and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds] could be subbed in to achieve the same result. But given his place as a forebear, DeBarge definitely deserves these redemption songs.
