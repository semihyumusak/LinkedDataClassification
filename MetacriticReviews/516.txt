Ultimately, like her manufactured pop rivals Ashlee Simpson and Hilary Duff, Lindsay is a little too superficial to sell us angst.
	Lohan's (admittedly studio-sheened) brand of pop darkness reads realer than Ashlee Simpson's. [9 Dec 2005, p.85]
	While this makes for an album that's substantially more interesting and cohesive than the gaudy Speak, it doesn't necessarily mean that A Little More Personal (Raw) is a successful record, either.
	Has she grown up? Maybe not entirely yet, but Lohan is showing the promise of an honorable mainstream career.
	Ms. Lohan has staked out a patch of musical ground between Kelly Clarkson and the Foo Fighters, and she can snarl a little without laying it on too thick. [5 Dec 2005]
	RAW is considerably more consistent than its predecessor, and it's not a bad listen by any means, but for all the so-called weighty subject matter, there's not much meat on these bones.
	The album de-emphasizes the (very) guilty pop pleasures of her 2004 debut in favor of leaden I-hate-you-Daddy laments.
	For most of the album, she sounds like any other self-absorbed teen, yearning to be Alanis, Gwen and even Stevie Nicks. [6 Dec 2005]
	The red flags run rampant in this album, which has all the personality of HAL 9000.
