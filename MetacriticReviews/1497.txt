It's the band--and Sturgis--who make Slave To The Game the most impressive album to date from the most underrated band in deathcore. [May 2012, p.72]
	This is easiest their finest work to date. [May 2012, p.100]
	Like many bands with a "core" attached to their sub-genre, Emmure are adept at making every song into an almost continuous, ferocious breakdown and it's a formula that keeps the album's momentum at its peak at all times.
	It won't be to everyone's tastes, but for those who like their metal both heavy and undeniably hook-laden, this is as satisfying an effort as you're likely to find.
	Slave To The Game shows that they've made no attempt to advance from the tedious, well-worn and weary chug, breakdown and death growl routine. [14 Apr 2012, p.54]
	Slave To The Game shows a band curious about more experimental sounds, however grating (note the steely, annoying electronics in "Umar Dumps Dormammu"), but perhaps too blockheaded to move further, remaining slaves to the tried-and-true Emmure din.
