May not be as postcard-perfect as I Am Shelby Lynne, but it comes pretty close.
	Exceptional, exemplary grown-up rock. [#4, p.120]
	Things sometimes tip too far into conventional rock clich√© -- "I Can't Wait" is too obvious a power ballad -- but for the most part, this is another display of Lynne's surprisingly agile range.
	Mostly all manner of shiny, happy pop.
	Continues in the same vein as its predecessor, matching Lynne's soulful vocals with an array of catchy tunes. [#184, p.140]
	It's sad to see the rocker side that Lynne has unveiled in her live sets turned into histrionic failures like "Trust Me," "Star Broker," and "Jesus On A Greyhound." [Dec 2001, p.154]
	Finds the sexy singer too often wading in the oversimplified pop influence of heavyweight producer Glen Ballard, her country sass and personality replaced by hackneyed and bland musical doodles.
	The edges have all been sawed off of Lynne's sound by producer and co-songwriter Glen Ballard, and she appears as a positively wimpy adult.
	Seems slickly over-produced and a little forced.
	She keeps shifting gears in an ill-advised attempt to please too broad an audience.
	Embarrassing.... It's hard to tell if [Ballard's] hyper-slick style is to blame, or if Lynne has simply hung herself. [16 Nov 2001, p.172]
	The disc's 10 tracks blur into a dispiriting, middle-of-the-road mishmash of lite pop, lite country, lite rock, and lite adult-contemporary.
