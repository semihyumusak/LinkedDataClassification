Impossible Spaces isn't simply the most accessible and immediately rewarding album to bear Sandro Perri's name, it also serves as a handy musical roadmap to its maker's sinuous creative course.
	Whatever these songs lack in immediacy, they rebound with an artistry.
	It's a spatial and musical theme across the whole of Impossible Spaces and it's perhaps the record's most deserving triumph.
	Quite naturally and organically, Sandro Perri is creating an impressive body of work outside of fashion or genre without really trying to do so.
	Suffice to say Impossible Spaces itself is a journey, and one of the more all-encompassing ones I've had the pleasure of taking this year.
	The whole of Impossible Spaces holds together as a strong listen, but in many ways it's the individual moments that stand out above all else.
	There is a generative sense of the perpetual "to be continued" and "to be announced" in both the projects of Benjamin and Torontonian songwriter Sandro Perri.
