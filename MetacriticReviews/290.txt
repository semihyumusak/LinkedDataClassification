A fully realized masterpiece.
	Almost every tune sounds like a hit. [Dec 2001, p.108]
	Trades the chilly, futuristic minimalism of S. Carter for a warmer, more organic sound rooted in the soul and funk of the '60s and '70s
	The Blueprint is possibly the least sonically inventive hip-hop chart topper in years-- stunning and captivating for sure, but still loungily comfortable enough to sleep to.
	By its close, 'The Blueprint' has eloquently mapped out life's foundations: laughter, tears, joy and pain, and has marked the Jigga as the complete rapper.
	Blueprint is his best since debuting with Reasonable Doubt in 1996.

	The Blueprint is not a perfect album. Some of the material is undoubtedly filler. But this recording makes it clear that hip-hop is supposed to be fun -- and that Jay-Z is having a ball.
	While The Blueprint falls short of his debut's brilliance, it is easily the best Jay Z recording since that release.
	The Bed-Stuy boy musters up enough of his own charisma, charm and wit to build another solid release.
	It's not radically new - although the Timbaland and the Trackmasters contributions are genuinely exciting - but it's exactly what a lot of people want to hear from a hip-hop album right now.
	But for an MC claiming to represent ''for the seat where Rosa Parks sat,'' one expects a bit more.
