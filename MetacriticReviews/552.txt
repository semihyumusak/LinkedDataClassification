She still suffers under the Whitney-Mariah delusion that Volume equals Passion, which proves to be her greatest undoing on this 11-song set.
	A mostly mainstream pop album with Latin inflections.
	With its superslick production and Mariah Carey-esque vocal histrionics, the "Latin" elements in Mi Reflejo are more sanitized than Santana-ized...
	Memo to self:... no matter how many foreign words I had to learn, I can still hit TONS of unnecessary high notes.
	An album that is just a little too familiar, even if it's classy and well-produced and spiked with a couple of new tunes that hold their own with the holdovers.
	Aguilera needs more than a just crash course in Spanish -- she needs a good translator (some songwriting help wouldn't hurt, either).
	This is purely a marketing scam gone too far.
