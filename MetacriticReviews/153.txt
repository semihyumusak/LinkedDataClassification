Their lyrics reveal the mysteries of true rolling stones. [16 Oct 2009, p.59]
	Taken on its own merits, this is life-enriching stuff.
	Their songs are evocative in ways music seldom is; you can feel the heat in their voices, picture the haze coming off the desert horizon, hear the dust getting into their microphones, their amps, under the strings of their guitar, slowly working its way into the sound itself.
	Another Tinariwen classic.
	Everything sounds deliciously grubby and unpolished.
	The results are quietly remarkable.
	The thing that stands out for me this time around is how little Tinariwen are confrontational about their experiences. Instead, it just naturally permeates their music--love songs with a thousand-yard stare.
	There is a unique magic to the sounds of the Sahara. Imidiwan captures that magic with skillful grace.
	There's a campfire vibe, though given the heat put out by even the acoustic jams, bonfire is more like it. The electric guitars flash like lightning, the looping melodies and Tamashek raps hypnotize.
