Their richest and most varied album to date.
	In all, it's easily their most ambitious--and praiseworthy--effort to date. [Apr 2012, p.92]
	If Move Along got the name in lights, it's Kids in the Street that ensures The All-American Rejects to be burning bright for years to come.
	Too many tracks here are cloaked in unnecessary hoopla, suffocating the best songs' breezy sweetness.
	Producer Greg Wells (Katy Perry, OneRepublic, Adele) dresses all that [emotional complexity and angst] up with greater sonic sophistication, guiding the All-American Rejects toward a more bombastic brand of pop.
	Ultimately Kids in the Street will go down as a solid album that is an ambitious and interesting grower... Nothing more, nothing less.
	Thankfully, [Tyson Ritter's] band shows signs of cracking through its own arrested development, especially in the sinuous groove of "Bleed Into Your Mind" and the sweetly vulnerable orchestral ballad "Affection."
	Their most subdued effort yet.
	The Rejects' return features too many reheated elements of their older sound, and often disastrous deviations when they stray from it.
	Kids in the Street is uninspired, '80s-laced material.
