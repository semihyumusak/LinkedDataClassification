It's a partially successful successor to "Yeah!," following through on some of the overall feel and punch but lacking enough songs to truly bring it across the goal line.
	The band's first new set since 2002 is full of these well-intentioned attempts to recapture some of that '80s pyromania (or in the case of the absurdly large power ballad 'Love,' herculean '70s prog-rock balladry), but without producer Robert "Mutt" Lange, who left for the much more profitable world of country years ago, the results are solid if unspectacular.
	While they must know they won’t be reinventing the wheel any time soon, Sparkle Lounge is their most upbeat music in a while.
	A true, if guilty pleasure. [june 2008, p.103]
	Def Leppard show signs of life on the headbanging 'Bad Actress,' which takes on the Lindsay Lohans of the world, but it’s clear they’re missing their old producer.
	A few bright spots don't make up for the album's general lack of immediacy or memorable hooks.
	Fans looking for an air-guitar gurning masterclass may be disappointed.
	Metal has teken giant evolutionary strides these past few years but, like mammoths frozen in ice, Def Leppard remain perfectly preserved in their own oblivion to them. [July 2008, p.91]
