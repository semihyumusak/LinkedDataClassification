There are too many skits, but there's still more than enough fun to go round. [#180, p.108]
	Redman sticks to what he does best on his fifth solo album, Malpractice, perfecting his blend of blunted silliness, brash irreverence, and sloppy funk.
	The presence of lengthy skits and less-skilled guests like Icarus and Double O.D. Don leaves little room for the impressive Redman himself. [6/15/2001, p.90]
	For the most part, Malpractice unfortunately matches Redman's pro forma boasts and refreshing modesty with pro forma music and not-so-refreshing beats.
	His new release might be his most sophomoric yet.
	The Doc's latest product, Malpractice, seems less focused and inspired than usual, and it lacks the kind of momentum that made albums such as Whut? Thee Album and Blackout, his 1999 collaboration with Method Man, instant classics.
	Redman comes up frustratingly short on thrills with an indulgent, complacent effort that takes you on a loooooong road to nowhere.
	His old-school MC sensibilities clash with his need to make unit-shifting quotas, and it trips up the record.
