	Blood For The Master veers expertly from bleak, blasting extremity to crazy-eyed thrash to ruinous punk rock, often all within the same song but never to the detriment of the band's core malevolent oh-so-metallic aggression. [Apr 2012, p.105]

	Their albums just get better and increasingly fun to listen, and Blood for the Master confirms that.
	Blood for the Master represents Goatwhore reverting back to their less-than-great death/thrash sonic territory, which is good for a quick listen, but not much more.
	For a band that's lyrically so devoted to upsetting the order, Goatwhore sound unequivocally content with replaying the past.
	Much here to relish: cold riff sleet ("Parasitic Scriptures of the Sacred Word"), while warplane thrust in "Death to the Architects of Heaven" and backup "An End to Nothing" top off Blood for the Master. But sound execution can't overcome a sadly generic whole.
