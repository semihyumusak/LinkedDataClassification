Like Badly Drawn Boy or Elliott Smith, his effervescent choruses, swooning harmonies, and heavily layered, my-studio-is-my-bunker production techniques on I'll Be Lightning are directly traceable to old Paul McCartney solo records.
	Finn writes irresistible songs that hum with riotous melodic invention.
	Finn's sonic tricks and references to love gone sour undercut the prettiness and hook the listener in, again and again. [Aug 2008, p.142]
	It exudes an organic, direct feel from which it gains its considerable charm. [Feb 2008, p.112]
	The 14 songs here seem stronger upon each listen, with the songs soon seeming indelible.
	I'll Be Lightning is a low-key charmer.
	Whatever it is that Finn has done in his lifetime to create such a compelling album is wondrous; he has taken the natural gifts from his father and paired them with his own musical capability.
	Generally, this is a perfect introduction to the talent of Liam Finn - and even at 14 tracks, it never outstays its welcome.
	What's striking about this set is that except for some drum parts and Neil playing bass on one tune, Liam's Lightning is bottled in his own one-man band, old-fashioned studio tricks and tape manipulation filling the gaps since he proudly proclaims that no computers were used in the making of the album.
	Odd instrumental touches crop up throughout the album, and there's a welcome layer of grit and murk to even the prettiest songs here.
	Skillful if occasionally rickety, Lightning showcases a confident, evolving voice.
	Yet even for all the familiarity to be found within its looping guitars and drums, Iâ€™ll Be Lightning also announces the arrival of a promising voice.
	His willingness to scribble over the pretty surfaces of his songs brings a bristling edge to his Beatlesque pop. [Feb 2008, p.79]
