The all-star collaborations form a fitting tribute to Jones' immaculate pop-soul style, with a few exceptions: We didn't need to hear Amy Winehouse stumble through "It's My Party."
	None of it's unpleasant to hear, particularly when someone as dependably charismatic as Snoop Dogg shows up, as the rapper does in a typically laidback take on "Get the Funk Out of My Face." And Jones hasn't lost his ear for great singers; Jennifer Hudson, John Legend and BeBe Winans all sound terrific. Yet too few of the album's 15 tracks seem brushed with the seductive audacity that defined Jones' groundbreaking collaborations with Michael Jackson.
	The sad thing is that if this concept had been presented as a one-off concert, it could have been amazing; a fitting tribute from the brightest stars of the 21st century to the man who taught them everything they know. But on record, it simply fails to take off. Quite frankly Quincy Jones, and his legacy, deserve better.
	There weren't too many opportunities for Jones to arrange or conduct during the course of this project, which is angled towards the vocal performance, whether sung or rapped. Its instrumental contributions serve mostly as a backdrop to the posturings of its guests.
	These carefully manicured, self-serving triffles nearly all fall flat, despite the nonstop roll-out of A-listers. [Feb 2011, p.108]
	Given Jones' legendary stature and reputation for taste, this set feels unnecessary at best, and downright cynical at worst.
