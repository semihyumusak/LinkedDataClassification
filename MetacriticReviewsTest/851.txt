	Invicta is a real treat. [Feb 2012, p.84]
	cta is Hit the Lights' ultimate bid for mainstream acceptance and also the quintet's strongest album to date.
	There are enough early anthems included to warrant picking this up, if only as a gateway to their back catalogue.
	The end result is that Invicta is pretty much for die-hard Hit the Lights or ponk fans only.
	The production is big on bluster and stadium-sized punch, but, sadly all of the passion's also been squeezed out here. [19 Feb 2012, p.51]
