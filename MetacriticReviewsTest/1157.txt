Like his frequent compadre Jay-Z, Rule loves his old-school R&B, but Rule's samples and grooves, rooted in '80s dance-floor pop, are more tuneful.
	What makes it a slightly better album than Rule 3:36, though, is the album's consistency.
	The hip-hopper's gravelly vocal style benefits greatly from the many collaborations here.
	The only problem is that Ja's ear for a hit has begun to make his straight street-level efforts less enticing.
	Ja Rule seems to be more interested in movin' on up (to the pop side) than keeping grounded on the gangsta grid.

	The tracks on this album contain the right beats to make listeners' heads bounce. But more thoughtful music lovers will simply shake their heads at the profuse profanity and misogynistic philosophies Ja Rule perpetuates with Pain Is Love.
	Ja Rule's only real gift is for crafting undeniable pop hooks. That talent is underrated, but it still does little to cover up the rapper's derivative lyrics and crassly recycled 2Pacisms.
