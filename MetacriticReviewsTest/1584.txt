A diverse and highly enjoyable ride.
	It's Winning Days softer songs that bubble up to replay themselves in your head. [26 Mar 2004, p.71]
	There's something about the precision of the gear changes and the crisp efficiency of Rob Schnapf's production that hits the spot, however derivatively. [Apr 2004, p.134]
	Winning Days is a noisy triumph -- as good as their 2002 debut, Highly Evolved, and in some ways a leap forward in style and frenzy.
	This album tends to lean more toward the psychedelic ballads, which slows down the action a little too much.
	The formula seems tired, or at least stretched too thin to be effective. [#9, p.101]
	This anonymous tone leaves an emotional void at the center of the album.
	I don't consider them rock saviors, but is it asking too much of a band to show a little musical growth?
	Inferior to not just Nirvana but Oasis.
	The album's midsection--in other words, just about everything between the first song and the last song--sags under the weight of midtempo, middle-of-the-road throwaways. [31 Mar 2004]
	As unremarkable and average a comeback as humanly possible.
	Ultimately, Winning Days is an highly frustrating listen.
	Winning Days is still more interesting than any album by obvious progenitors Oasis because the good parts come up at the most random moments--spontaneous solo here, appealing harmony there.
	There seems to be a hollowness, a lack of soul, an empty Big Mac carton where this album's heart should be.
	It's hard to fight the feeling this is average songwriting buffed into something near-palatable by the amount of money spent on it. [Apr 2004, p.101]
	The Vines are mostly surface and scratch, a vessel of strangely useless beauty. [Apr 2004, p.114]
	Accomplished and full of bluster but ontologically completely hollow; this is The Vines.
	Musically, it's a mess.
	[They've] hit difficult-third-album syndrome one album early.
	About as personality-free as rock music gets. [Apr 2004, p.115]
	The disc's highlight, "TV Pro," ably blends the band's two moods and adds some promise to an otherwise bland and vacant offering.
	The Vines earn real damnation as Winning Days comes to a close. However boring and harmlessly vapid the first ten tracks are, "F.T.W." obliterates any possibility of forgiving them.
	There's not much left for the Vines' frontman other than his music, which on Winning Days seems more like an afterthought--if not the work of an unbearably bad Oasis record. [Apr 2004, p.98]

	One of the most underrated rock albums of the generation, Winning Days should have been the record that installed The Vines as one theOne of the most underrated rock albums of the generation, Winning Days should have been the record that installed The Vines as one the definitive rock bands of the 2000's.Sadly the victim of unfounded press backlash, The Vines suffered at the very hands of those who had fostered the hype surrounding their debut effort "Highly Evolved".Admittedly, Winning Days never reaches the level of brilliance seen in Highly Evolved (tracks like "Evil Town" are bordering on abysmal) but it is still an outstanding album in its own right - featuring sweet melodic perfection in softer tracks like "Rainfall", "Amnesia" and "Sun Child". The title track "Winning Days" finishes with an uplifting flourish unmatched by any of their previous recordings, and songs like "Animal Machine" and the crowd (and advertising) favourite "Ride" retain the high energy rock edge that gave The Vines their initial reputation, lending themselves brilliantly to live performance.The problem I saw with this album's initial reception, is that most media critics were looking for an album stacked with 12 versions of Get Free, Outtathaway and Ride - often describing Winning Days as "bland". In this ignorant and oblivious process, they missed out on the genius within this album of melodic accomplishment.A great album overall.… Full Review »
