Teetering between darkness and light, Hersh's somersaults have never been more compelling.
	As usual, the results are exquisitely unsettling... [3/9/2001, p.82]
	Some of the lyrics are so biting they practically melt through the speakers... [#50, p.90]
	It contains some of the most affecting work she's ever created, exploring the power of songs stripped to their essence, and the juxtaposition of delicate melodies with the explosive emotions conveyed by her lyrics.
	Diminutive, but mom-tough, Hersh casually cusses her way through a baker's dozen songs that are as personal as ever, and far less cryptic than in the past. Her voice remains creaky and pregnant with emotion, matched against her signature bright-toned Collings guitars.
	Sunny Border Blue marks a return to a less considered, rawer style, and to lyrics which are nakedly confessional, mercilessly exposing her own and other people's weaknesses. [#206, p.67]
	Beautifully strange and richly tuneful...
	Sunny Border Blue will go down as her finest album outside of the Throwing Muses because its her finest batch of songs.
	Understated but never anemic, Sunny Border Blue's tales of love, family and growth succeed largely due to Hersh's masterful acoustic guitar. [#154, p.81]
	A few too many songs share tempos, melodies, and moods to make this a great Kristin Hersh album, but it's still a very good one that her longtime fans will appreciate.
	This is more of simply Hersh and an acoustic guitar than her last effort (1999's Sky Motel), but that just gives the appearance of other instruments greater effect. The emotional weight of her often unorthodox sentiments comes from subtle mastery of dynamics.
	Astormy soundtrack to one woman's inner life that swings from acoustic guitars to explosions of layered vocals, electric guitars and the occasional lonely horn or piano.
	Largely acoustic, the album showcases a beautifully brutal collection of warped love songs; pristine and jagged, abrasive and tender and always devastatingly honest.
	As with all her solo work, Sunny Border Blue practically bleeds with catharsis and introspection, but foraging through its dark interiors yields moments of strange, exquisite beauty.
	These are skewed, disturbing, beautiful songs...
	The extremely beautiful and ever so slightly disturbing soundtrack to my my late teens.
	Next to "Hips & Makers," her best solo LP.
	Kristin Hersh is a brilliant singer/songwriter! I can't think of anyone else that moves me the way she does! She is one of a kind! Sunny Kristin Hersh is a brilliant singer/songwriter!
