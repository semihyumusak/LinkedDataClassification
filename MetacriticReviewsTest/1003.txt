Happy New Year is fresh and adventurous and, most important, it is consistently so.
	Oneida still imprint each song with their own warped sensibility. [14 Jul 2006, p.81]
	A lean and brawny collection of experimental pop songs with the brains to match. [#14]
	Happy New Year is unpretentiously unique, challenging and eclectic.
	This is a great band at or near the top of its game.
	The album is a perfect introduction for latecomers to this essential New York band.
	Oneida have blossomed into a welcoming landscape all their own. [#21, p.102]
	What "Happy New Year" really represents is Oneida's finest, most complete record to date, and as such it's the perfect starting point for anyone who's as yet unfamiliar with their rather daunting back catalog.
	It's a poetic work of circling guitars and melodic phrases and vocal lines repeating and layered like monastic chants.

	Happy New Year's only flaw is that the second half drifts a bit.
	You could easily call this the sequel to Secret Wars - it has the same mix of baked acoustics, crushing organ and electric guitar lines, staccato vocals, and a meditative finale built around interlocked piano and drums.
	It's all wilfully haphazard, though the fact that they never sound like they're taking things too seriously happily dispels the whiff of pretension. [Sep 2006, p.110]
	The trio's shared vocals are a unifying factor, finessing the outre music into gently hypnotic melodies. [Sep 2006, p.94]
	An odd album, more experimental than their previous album and at the same time less enjoyable. Too Dense and a little to self contrived.
