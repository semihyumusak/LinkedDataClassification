11 tracks of classic ambient house and melodic decks and EFX exercises. [Sep 2004, p.116]
	Showcases the Orb back in peak form.
	There's precious little here not to like, and it's as satisfying an experience as any of the ambient survivors have produced in years.
	In the grand scheme of Orb albums, it lands as slightly better than their last effort Cydonia, but not nearly as good as classics like Orbus Terrarum.
	The Orb's latter-day incarnation lands closer to the dance floor than the chill-out room. It also sounds rootless and unfocused, in ways good and bad.
	It's disappointing to hear them following trends rather than inspiring them.
	While they're hardly cutting-edge these days, The Orb's gently pleasing grooves... still work as aural enhancers for the cannabinoidally-incliined. [Jun 2004, p.114]
	Though Patterson is still largely peddling outdated sample-heavy narco-trance, the new disc is quite an improvement from 2001s career-low Cydonia even if it may share that records flaws.
	Bicycles & Tricycles is a bit of a letdown, especially after a three-year absence.
	A bumpy ride, but a diverting one.
	It's originality that's lacking. [Jun 2004, p.105]
	More like an album of B-sides than an original work. [#7]
	More of the same from an act who have been ploughing the same furrow for so long they'll be reaching the Earth's core soon. [5 Jun 2004, p.57]
	a tweak in another dimesion still inspiring, listen out for orbient humour exquisite and uplifting
	Very good ambient album... Super rythms and noises.
