A sexy record, of a kind that no one else seems to be making anymore.
	It has an appealing gentle earnestness that most pop music lost somewhere in the past few decades.
	A set of appealing folk-rock ditties shot through with girl-group sweetness and a soupcon of punky attitude. [1 Aug 2003, p.79]
	Packed with great songs and performances, it re-establishes Golightly as a beacon of grace and restraint in a world sadly bereft of both.
	It's Golightly's most genuine, dark-struttin' My Generation-type record to date.
	Sound[s] authentically retro without ever veering into Lenny Kravitz territory. [Sep 2003, p.101]
	Her sultry rasp--think Nancy Sinatra meets Bettye Lavette--delivers disquieting, brooding self-penned originals over warped, folk-tinged, electric blues. [Sep 2003, p.110]
	Golightly brings out rock'n'roll's original transgressive spirit. [#60, p.98]
	The downside to this is that she sounds like shes on her best behavior; the songs stay awfully polite and sprightly for someone whos so good at sounding sinister. The upside is that underneath that dress, ready to impress strangers, Hollys still pretty near top form.
	A mellow, stripped-down effort. [#5, p.113]
	Her torchy virtuosity on her medium-small vocal instrument, applied to country-bluesy-Stonesy ballads and driving midtempo rave-ups, transforms what could have been a dull exercise in rote revivalism into sweet soul music.

Holly and co. exemplify the essence of rock n' roll, rhythm and blues, and vintage pop by crafting an album full of songs that are instantly catchy and simple, yet brimming with atmosphere. Holly's seductive, mature voice give the music a subdued quality that is increasingly rare today. She and her band prove that it's often what you don't hear that's important. Subtlety is Ms. Golightly's mantra, and it works perfectly. Truly she is none other. What else is there to say?… Full Review »
	I came to this pretty late, but since no one else here has commented on it, maybe I'm early. Holly Golightly (great name with respects I came to this pretty late, but since no one else here has commented on it, maybe I'm early. Holly Golightly (great name with respects to Truman Capote) doesn't have what you would call the greatest voice in the world, but after only a couple of spins, I was hooked by her honesty and wisdom. She is completely REAL. It's amazing what a rainbow of emotions and sounds she creates in the seemingly-limited genre of 60s-ish, stripped-down garage rock. I'll probably have to track down some of her earlier stuff, even though I'm known for not wanting anything "ancient" (more than a year old.) Well, even if I never do, these 13 songs will keep me coming back because they're timeless. And, oh yes, I LOVE her voice now.… Full Review »
