The lack of pretense on his second album makes him an approachable Everypimp, and he gets nothing but love from [his] guests. [Dec 2004, p.138]
	More consistent and satisfying than its predecessor. [14 Nov 2004]
	The kind of slick, articulate boogie rap that may get Nelly to wondering if the Lou is big enough for the both of them. [19 Nov 2004, p.82]
	His rhymes don't say much new, and the repetitive bounce of Powerballin' rattles your head after a while.
	It's not that the album isn't good, it's that it pails in comparison to "Jackpot."
	More solid than spectacular. [Jan 2005, p.83]
	Jackpot is superior in every aspect.
	Chingy is charming in presence and in singsong flow, but not particularly engaging. [25 Nov 2004, p.91]
	The constant talk of expensive cars, gyrating women and endless parties quickly becomes redundant--and boring.
