A most pleasurable guilty pleasure.
	If you think songs get into trouble past the three-minute mark and words are nothing more than things that fall out of your mouth, D-D-Don't Don't Stop The Beat is the record for you. [8 Aug 2003, p.71]
	Gleeful, glorious, and utterly unique.
	They are basically just the Archies for our generation, a transcendent bubblegum band that works its ass off to make all this stuff look easy.
	It's like each song on the album has the dynamics and reach of a DJ set, ramming David Bowie and Fats Domino into K.C. and the Sunshine Band, then gluing it together with full-throated sugar-pop harmonies and a rhythm section worthy of the Beatles at Hamburg's Star Club.
	Their hedonistic sex-dance anthems go down a treat. [Apr 2003, p.103]
	The results are goofy but undeniably exhilarating.
	Ceaselessly enthusiastic European dance-pop that's deliriously colorful, vividly inane and usually about themselves. [Aug 2003, p.126]
	Pop doesn't get much more gloriously trashy than this. [Apr 2003, p.108]
	By not being "smart" enough to subdivide their appreciation of pop into a series of echo chambers, Junior Senior comes close to recapturing the preteen joy of responding to music unhindered by stigma.
	All the songs sound almost exactly the same. I dont care! It doesnt matter! Just dance!
	[Sounds] as much like playful garage-rock as cocky Europop.
	A high-spirited whoosh of urgent dance pop and groovy psychedelic bop. [Sep 2003, p.102]
	Junior Senior plays pop music, pure and simple, and the abundant joys on D-D-Don't should make even the most hopeless cynic reevaluate priorities that don't allow for pop's fleeting glories.
	Funky like Fred Schneider and Barney Fife killin' it at karaoke. [Sep 2003, p.115]
	Ultimately, though, the resolutely rubbish recordings--distorted, trebly drum breaks, scratchy guitars, monotonous voices--and near-total absence of melody, might test your stamina for mindless entertainment. [May 2003, p.104]
	Taken in three-minute doses, 'D-D-Don't Stop The Beat' sounds fantastic. Taken all at once, it's proof that too much fun can be hard to bear.
	These Danes aren't tuned-in enough for stereotype play.
	Absolutely brilliant, an essential record.  This is dance music for people who don't care too much for dance music. It's like a huge, greatAbsolutely brilliant, an essential record.
