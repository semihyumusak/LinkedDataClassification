Here, Nas is so fierce, so plainspoken, so lean with words, that he demolishes not just the oeuvre of our ruling rappers (yes, including Eminem's) and recalls the music's lyrical champs like Rakim, he even brings to mind hip-hop progenitors like Muhammad Ali in the "Rumble in the Jungle" era.
	While this album isn't quite as good as the now legendary Stillmatic, it is one of the best hip-hop discs to drop in some time.
	Thought-provoking and masterful, God's Son finds Nas finally realizing his full potential as an MC.
	It's not all brilliant, but there's enough of brilliance here to convince.
	In many ways, God's Son is lyrically superior to Illmatic. Nas has created an album that is at once mournful and resilient, street-savvy and academic.
	The nice thing about Gods Son, although it isnt fantastic or at the level of Stillmatic, is that it honestly doesnt feel rushed. Nas is responsible for the lyrical content of the album, and it, like his previous releases, is nearly flawless.
	Nas, it seems, wants his crown back. [#13, p.95]
	The risks he takes with the production are a big part of the allure of God's Son. [Feb 2003, p.135]
	Jigga may have the edge right now, but on this evidence Nas looks the better bet in the long run. [Mar 2003, p.112]
	God's Son isn't quite the masterpiece is could be -- mostly because Nas is so self-involved, sometimes seemingly intoxicated by his kingliness --  but it's surely one of the most remarkable albums of the Queensbridge rapper's highlight-filled career, just a notch or so below Illmatic and Stillmatic.
	Mostly this is Nas going back to his former role as a keen street observer, ready to dispense wisdom to up-and-coming youngbloods.
	As with all thug poetry, the ego and malice are blinding, but moments of self-deprecation and social responsibility out-flash the gun bursts.
	This is mostly a sombre affair. [Mar 2003, p.106]
	After years of puzzling releases, Nas has finally delivered a collection worthy of his landmark 1994 debut.
	God's Son is a worthy follow-up to Stillmatic.
	A welcome return to form.
	Nas' heart is in the right place but his mind is somewhere else entirely. [March 2003, p.119]
	Nas doesn't ruin a decent beat, but rarely is he able to improve one.
	And Nasty Nas strikes again with another platinum WORTHY album, which many artists never are WORTHY but go platinum anyway. Nas tells littleAnd Nasty Nas strikes again with another platinum WORTHY album, which many artists never are WORTHY but go platinum anyway. Nas tells little ghetto children to follow their dreams, dedicated songs to his mother who recently died, and had a song with Pac. Pac who died six years before, beefed with Nas and Mobb Deep, and Nas forgives and forgets it all, to feature 2Pac & J. Phoenix in Thugz Mansion N.Y. And all of this in the midst of the Nas - Jigga feud that Nas won and Jigga the fake ass n**** had to hope for forgiveness for sucking ****. Nas followed Stillmatic with his 4th instant classic album that won the feud. At this point, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Jones should be a household name everywhere.… Full Review »

The beats are not consistent throughout the album and as a result it meanders all over the place. There are definitely some goods songs on God's Son but the filler kind of ruins the album as a whole. Nas even throws some of his discarded, "b-side" lyrics into "Book of Rhymes" and ruins what otherwise could have been a good song. Really Nas - you were so lazy that you couldn't write some new lyrics for this dope beat by Alchemist? Unfortunately, for me this album marked the beginning of the end for a great artist.… Full Review »
