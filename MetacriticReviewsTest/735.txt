Allen has fused together a uniquely acidic brand of pop, and the icing on the cake is that brutally barbed tongue.
	The female Mike Skinner? She's far, far better than that.
	A great summer record it remains, even in the dead of winter.
	Only two songs ring false. [Feb/Mar 2007]
	The pop album of the year.
	What's amazing about Alright, Still is how similar the girl with the blog is to the girl with the hit record. [Mar 2007, p.129]
	Like Blondie circa 1981, Allen breathes needed fresh air into the game.
	A seeping, heaving summer album through and through.
	In terms of a debut record-- and especially given the weight of expectation placed on her to deliver something special-- Alright, Still isnâ??t anything else but a fantastic success.
	Sheâ??s funky, confident and fun, and thatâ??s just on the first song.
	Pop music needed saving and in Lily Allen we've found just the woman to do it.
	This may just be [the] finest pop break-up album since [Justin] Timberlake's Justified. [Aug 2006, p.95]
	A blast from start to finish. [Aug 2006, p.102]
	The music deliberately sits somewhere between glossy and unobtrusive. It shimmers enough to mask Allen's tepid singing voice but remains far enough away to allow her largest asset -- her snappy personality -- to take charge.
	Allen [is] one of the wittiest new voices in pop. [#16, p.89]
	Alright's sparkly high-life beats... all gleam with upmarket panache. But strong medicine always requires a little sugar. [Feb 2007, p.82]
	As much of a clichÃ© as it is, you're either going to love Allen or hate her.
	If the pop dreams get slightly tarnished by the graffiti put-downs of 'Not Big' (her ex has a 'size problem') and 'Alfie' (her brother smokes too much dope) then that's not too worrying. With a personality this size, this isn't the last time you'll be hearing from her.
	A simple, smart pop record by one of the most charismatic young talents to come along in a while.
	Enough of Alright, Still works -- as pure pop and on the meta level Allen aims for -- to make the album a fun, summery fling, and maybe more.
	An incisive and funny introduction to the 21-year-old English singer.
	She never sounds like she's trying too hard.
	Lyrically, Allen spins the street-slang tales of blowjobs and booze told with varying success by everyone from The Streets to Shampoo.
	For now, it's way more than a stop-gap but sadly not the second coming you might have been hoping for.
	The overall effect is not dissimilar to Sugababes, only with added adult content. [Aug 2006, p.111]
	The production on tracks like "Shame For You" and "Alfie" is fantastic, and there are plenty of catchy melodies and clever samples, but Allen is a poser who lacks charisma, bites off of everyone else, and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad "Littlest Things" seem like a farce.
	Alright Still is nothing more than pop for people who hate pop music, poptimist Quorn, phony music for people who can't let go of their inhibitions (indie-bitions?) and have to have their music classified as REAL.
	The best of britpop began with this beautiful pin-up album from Lily Allen. She setted again the fire for the pop from the Great Britain, withThe best of britpop began with this beautiful pin-up album from Lily Allen. She setted again the fire for the pop from the Great Britain, with different style. We get the best from her in 'Alfie', 'Smile' and 'LDN', songs that remind us from the very first beggining of the knockout of England, musically speaking.… Full Review »
	I thought this album was really good! Its way different to other pop albums and Lily uses really new and unique lyrics! She also deals with I thought this album was really good! Its way different to other pop albums and Lily uses really new and unique lyrics! She also deals with issues which teens can relate to! Such as having an annoying sibling (Alfie) or finding out people arent true friends (friend of mine)! This is a must have album in my opinion!… Full Review »
	Really enjoyed some of her tracks......but listening to the album straight through is a straight bore. She has this nonchalant monotone voice Really enjoyed some of her tracks......but listening to the album straight through is a straight bore.
