Blood Like Lemonade exceeds expectations, coming in a close second behind fan favorite Big Calm.
	It's not an album that will change your life, but its airy grooves make for perfectly pleasant listening for under an hour. And sometimes, that's all you need.

	Usually when a band reforms, fans hope it's because the group has something to say with its new release. Unfortunately, Blood Like Lemonade, has little to say to even Morcheeba's most dedicated fans.
