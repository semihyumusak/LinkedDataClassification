A fine new outing.
	This is an album packed not only with exuberant and quirkily innovative songs--songs that are busy with bounce and swerve--but also come equipped with a sense of energy and defiance that suggests that their authors are not going to give up simply because the terrain underfoot has become unsteady. [Sept 17 2011, p.52]
	Yes, it is undoubtedly inferior to its predecessor, but it instantly delivers an enjoyable crowd-pleasing package.
	The bombast is blunted by a lyrical clumsiness, but if you've stopped to analyse them, then you've already missed the point of The Subways' exuberant pep. [Oct 2011, p.130]
	While it contains a few filler songs, this is a fun album to listen to, bursting with irrepressible energy.
	Deep it is not, and its aspirations to be something greater keep it from being truly trashy fun, but there are enough energy and hooks to keep Money and Celebrity entertaining.
	Nearly every track is catchy enough but for an act in the business of cheap, good time thrills, most fall too far from the bountiful tree of old.
	After two albums treading water in the tricky oceans of landfill indie, the tides are turning.
