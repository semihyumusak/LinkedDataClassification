A rare and fascinating glimpse into the raw stuff of the creative process. [Jan 2004, p.103]
	A rare peep at the methods of a great songwriter. [Feb 2004, p.98]
	Aside from a handful of instrumental snatches... Democrazy's main events are six or seven tantalising sketches. [Jan 2004, p.96]
	It is occasionally brilliant and frequently irritating beyond belief.
	Serving as nothing more than a temporary diversion or side note to his fully realised work, this is worth a cursory listen for the insight alone.
	He's already recorded such a wealth of great material that no mystique remains, leaving no real reason for anyone-- including the most dedicated fan-- to seek out these poorly produced musical shreds.
	On the evidence of 'Democrazy', the wrong self-indulgent flake got fired from Blur.
	There are very limited redeeming qualities to this collection of poorly played, badly written tripe.
	And what illuminating revelation do we learn from the half conceived, cottonmouthed rubbish that constitutes Democrazy? In full: thank Christ Blur usually finish writing their songs before they sell them, otherwise theyd be shit.
	Damon is a genius....get used to it.
	I first wanted to note Democrazy "9", but actually, I really think that this record is "perfect", because it's not an album like I first wanted to note Democrazy "9", but actually, I really think that this record is "perfect", because it's not an album like another, it doesn't want to be good from part to part, this is not his aim. Damon Albarn gives us something really new, we can explore the way he works and feel how music runs in his head. It's fascinating. Of course some titles aren't that good, but this is so logical, this is only a first work on them and these ideas of songs never asked to be considered as future best-sellers. And on the other hand, some songs are just great without being finished. I think that people who critic this album like another don't understand it, and the interest of it. This is not a record to listen in your living room while doing the house work. This is an experience, a good idea for people who want to be closer to the music they love. In reality, exactly like in this record, songwritters have ideas and some are better than others. I just feel like this album is sincere, and because of that, it couldn't be better.… Full Review »
	First off, I have to say that I think Albarn is a musical genius, who doesn't get as much credit as maybe he deserves. That being said, First off, I have to say that I think Albarn is a musical genius, who doesn't get as much credit as maybe he deserves. That being said, in this "album" he explores many a good tunes. Yes, he does carry on a bit too much with the droning sounds of what he has lying around on songs like "dezert" and "reedz," but there is also evidence of some of the most intriguing music i think he has written. there is a certain offbeatness to each of the stand-out tracks, like "half a song" and "american welfare poem," that have a definite feel to them, but a sense of looseness that i welcome when i listened to them. there is also a quality of these truly rough cuts that is very much more personal than something refined or produced. rare mixes are always funbecause they are truly more heartfelt and honest. albarn is a shifty character, whose public persona is often misunderstood, and it is nice to get this close to such a man.… Full Review »
