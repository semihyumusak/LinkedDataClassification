A sizeable chunk of the album contains what is by far some of the best material this group has done in ages.
	In making consistently mediocre music, the group appeals to the country fan with the lowest expectations out of life, one who never wants his moon-pie-and-RC-Cola values challenged, but likes his emotions jostled once in a while.
	While the album is a distinct improvement on 1999's Twentieth Century, it still fails to rise above the level of a few good songs padded by a whole lot of filler.
	Problem is, Alabama's pop panache, which made it at least a guilty pleasure for much of the '80s, seems to have been replaced by an impulse toward pure schmaltz.
