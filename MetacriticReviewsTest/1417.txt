Good Shoes have home-produced a record worthy of similar plaudits; there’s both hope and future here in abundance.
	No Hope, No Future doesn’t always play to the band’s proven strengths, but it shows that Good Shoes are a thoroughly independent, even contrary band that's unafraid of change, even when it’s difficult.
	With no delusions of grandeur attached to a debilitating hype machine, Good Shoes seem happy remaining cranky young men in their niche, keeping their less-than-stadium-sized but fervent crowd on their toes.
	The main problem with No Hope, No Future, though, is that very little here stands out above the accepted and expected norm. At times, there's a feeling Good Shoes have almost resigned themselves to a destined state of mediocrity.
	It sounds like the Good Shoes are tired and mildly sick of it all--and unfortunately, it’s catching.
	When Jones starts singing about Clapham over the clipped, welter-weight indie of this quartet's second studio album it begins to seem a curiously south-eastern English rock vision - the clean guitars and Cure-style vocals suggesting a lighter shade of Bloc Party. [Feb 2010, p. 92]
	Although reaching a touching peak on melancholic closer City By The Sea, two albums in Good Shoes still lack a defining personality of their own. [Feb 2010, p. 107]
	A darker album, a slightly clumsier album, but an album with a strong unifying themes and a few songs worth stepping away from the bar for.
	London quartet Good Shoes offer little to get flustered over with this sometimes dire, but mostly mediocre second album.
	It's a moment to rejoice on an album that just feels flaccid in comparison to the youthful debut.
	As the title suggests, No Hope, No Future is rather short on vim. The wiry, Wire-y dynamics are mostly presnt and correct. [Feb 2010, p.86]
