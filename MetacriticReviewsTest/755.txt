This London-based crooner emerged in the early '00s as the face of Britain's 2-step scene, but on his fourth full-length Craig David doesn't sound tethered to any one sound in particular.
	Throughout, Southampton's own R Kelly, as silky-voiced as ever, seems determined to seize hold of his iffy image and re-establish his old school soul credentials.
	'Trust Me’ works, kinda, by doing R&B without palely imitating US fare: take ‘Hot Stuff’, smooth ’80s dance-pop that makes game use of Bowie’s ‘Let’s Dance’.
	This is predictably slick and inoffensive stuff. [Dec 2007, p.90]
	There was a variety of styles on Trust Me, none of which detracted from its overall sense of cohesion.
	Craig David's back, and in fairness, he makes a decent fist of it. However, David is hamstrung by trying to please both critic and fan.
	All the ingredients for another hit album are here. The only thing missing is soul. [Dec 2007, p.110]
	Craig David seems to have accepted he's destined to occupy the middle of the road. Trouble is, it's still not clear which road he's on. [Dec 2007, p.115]
	Trust Me opens with a triptych of horn-section-and-samples R&B numbers that bounce along pleasantly, even if they can't quite shake off the cut-price dancefloor feeling that permeates so much British pop; but they are still preferable to the succession of puppy-eyed ballads, almost wholly devoid of interest or edge, which follow.
	Expected a lot. Very disappointed.
