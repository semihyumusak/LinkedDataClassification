Although his latest is less personal, it has a similarly broad emotional scope and a warm sonic palette far from the house-rocking R&B that’s the foundation of his four-decade career.
	Wolf’s touch here is easy and assured, so it feels familiar upon the first spin but better upon repeats, when the songs truly take hold and the conversational nature of the performances settle in, revealing the warmth and skill beneath the surface.
	This delightful new album makes one thing clear: Nothing can kill Wolf's charm, musicality and youthfulness.
	Midnight Souvenirs is highlighted by pristine production. Like its two predecessors, the disc features a warm, deep sound with sophisticated arrangements that layer on background vocals, strings, horns, and meticulous songwriting while never sounding busy or labored.
	It's to his credit that he's avoided anything resembling a persona with a warm, solid set that's alternately thoughtful, rocking, and funky, and possibly his best solo album. [Spring 2010, p.75]
	Wolf's twofold skillfulness and stirring guest performances compensate for the sometimes overcooked arrangements. [Apr 2010, p.109]
