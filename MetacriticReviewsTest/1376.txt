This is the debut record of the year so far, which has effectively raised the bar by which other bands will be judged in the future.
	As with other really good bands in this genre (such as Franz Ferdinand and Interpol) it transcends being just a mere mash of influences.
	Dirty Words' accomplishment lies in its superficiality: its pristine, immaculate finish.
	Somewhere between a funk soul Killers and an Interpol with lyrics that actually make sense. [11 Jun 2005, p.67]
	It's an awkward, not entirely likeable mix. [Jul 2005, p.106]
	While the icy Joy Division guitar chords and singer Davide Jones's faux-cockney delivery never sound entirely natural, their energy is compulsive. [Jul 2005, p.113]
	There's little in The Departure to justify the trip.
	They lack a style or personality of their own. [Jul 2005, p.106]
	And the thing is, an over-reliance on pastiche wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for the fact that a) they’re running in grooves created by the wheels of the bandwagon they’ve arrived too late to jump on and b) they tackle it all in the most hopeless, hapless, school talent show cover band style of derivation imaginable.
	a little gem this one. yes its heavily reliant on the past, but lets face it, oasis vs beetles anyone?? Give this a go, its well worth your while :)
	not bad at all.....if you like early U2, the chameleons, and bauhaus pick it up - you could do worse
	a smashing, infectious debut!
