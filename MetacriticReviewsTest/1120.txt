In Your Dreams, Nicks' first studio album since 2001, is also streaked with the witchy-woman weirdness only she can bring.
	There's still only one Stevie Nicks – witchy, mystical and romantic.
	Lindsey Buckingham appears on the quiet Soldier's Angel, and he and Nicks interlock in a unique way that tells us these two, at least musically, are bound together for life.
	With help from producers Dave Stewart of Eurythmics - who co-wrote seven songs as well - and Glen Ballard, Nicks sings of big loves and losses and sprinkles them with her enchanted glitter of optimism, melancholy, ecstasy, and regret.
	In Your Dreams winds up capturing the essence of Stevie Nicks, which -- as her previous three decades of solo albums prove -- is no easy feat.
	The gypsy queen is in royal form on In Your Dreams - it's not just her first album in 10 years, it's her finest collection of songs since the Eighties.
	The production doesn't always give Nicks's gothic imagery enough waft, but fans will love puzzling over which of her paramours she's recalling on Secret Love.
	Those fiercely loyal fans will be very pleased with In Your Dreams, a pit stop in her canon of rock folklore.
	The caprine warble of solo Steve Nicks has broken its silence after 10 years to explore the idea that nothing lasts forever, especially in affairs of the heart.
	Producer Dave Stewart has helped create an album that sounds exactly like the Nicks of myth: spooky, otherworldly, emotional and sassy, yet stalked by some undefinable melancholy.
	Nicks co-produces with Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard. [July 2011, p. 102]
	There are moments where the weirdly wonderful pagan pixie princess pokes through. [Jul 2011, p.90]
	Over the course of this slightly bloated track listing there is too much focus on the soft rock element of her sound and this which works to the detriment of her fascinating lyrics and bewitching theatrics.
	In Your Dreams is an album about exorcising the demons of the past and moving forward toward the beauty lingering in our imaginations.
	She sounds more engaged than she has in years. Not the disgrace it could have been. [July 2011, p. 117]
	For all the juvenilia of the songwriting, the production on In Your Dreams is an oldster's abomination, lacquering dated MOR bombast over intermittently inspired melodies that wilt on impact.
	It's an album full of the sort of drippy ballads and droopy soft rock that should induce an involuntary gag reflex in anyone under the age of 45.
	In Your Dreams indulges in some of Nicks's worst tendencies as a songwriter and is slathered in chintzy, dated production values.
	This is what it's all about people! Real music, something that's very rare now. "In Your Dreams" is one album that's in a class by itself.This is what it's all about people!

	It's amazing that 4 decades into an incredible career Stevie Nicks has released her best solo album ever.  There are so many amazing songs onIt's amazing that 4 decades into an incredible career Stevie Nicks has released her best solo album ever.  There are so many amazing songs on this record that it's difficult to pick a favorite, and there isn't one bad song in the bunch.  "Moonlight", "Annabel Lee" and "New Orleans" approach Fleetwood Mac levels of greatness.  "Secret Love" is a well-written song from the Rumours days.  "For What It's Worth" sounds like a modern "Landslide".  "In Your Dreams" and "Everybody Loves You" are very catchy and sound like potential singles, and "Wide Sargasso Sea" and "Ghosts Are Gone" crank up the electric guitars.  Nicks hasn't sang so well on an album since 1982's The Wild Heart.  This album is a classic.… Full Review »
