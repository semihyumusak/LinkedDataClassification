Accessible enough for people who learn about new music from [NPR] and sonically interesting enough to appeal to hardcore electroheads. [May 2004, p.110]
	The sheer enveloping bliss elicited by hearing the album in one sitting (especially in public  'Faking The Books' is a headphone masterpiece and no mistake) leaves one wishing it were a whole lot longer than its taut 40-minute duration.
	Their sound is an interesting polyglot, one as easily accessible to dance minimalists and brown corduroy-wearing emo boys, and with nary a compromise. [Apr 2004, p.86]
	Another truly wondrous record. [May 2004, p.99]

	If invention and imagination are the criteria to judge, this is a future classic.
	Faking the Books... is to Tridecoder and Scary World Theory as OK Computer was to The Bends  a quantum evolutionary leap that, taken consecutively, quite takes your breath away.
	Electronic elements balance out the harsh guitars with regularity, resulting in a handful of full-blown zingers.
