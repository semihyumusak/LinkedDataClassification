One of the year's best.
	A magnum opus four years in the making, We Love Life is, like This Is Hardcore's epic cold sweat, a disco-nnection record, well stocked with mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits. But Pulp's glamorama has never tingled so invitingly, thanks to the full-body massage administered by producer Scott Walker.
	An emotional and musical breakthrough.
	Preposterous and sensational, We Love Life grapples with nothing less than how best to prove you're alive. [Oct 2002, p.116]
	Weeds, an excellent tune which compares the English working class to this type of plants, is only one of the various epic, melodramatic tunes in the key of Scott Walker (who produced the record) present here that use elements of nature to symbolise aspects of modern society and the human condition itself.
	His most winsomely loveless lyrics yet. [Oct 2002, p.92]
	Pulp have pulled off yet another remarkable reinvention of their sound and outlook, while simultaneously making their most organic album since their full-length debut, It, was released almost two decades ago.
	Its surging orchestrations and and acoustic subtelties seem willfully out of step with current trends, taking time to reveal their unique, and very British, charms.
	We Love Life trades Pulp's characteristic risk-taking for smooth accessibility, which works a gray, rainy day magic over the proceedings.
	An album as life-affirming as its predecessor was bleak.
	At its best, 'We Love Life' features some of the finest British rock music of recent years.
	We Love Life is an album that trades the group's tongue-in-cheek gimmicks and satirical savvy for a mode of pensive moderation and subtle telling.
	Cocker's treasurable wit and the band's seventh album have taken a corporation bus ride out for strange, poetic interludes among the trees and the undergrowth.
	The instant pop buzz Pulp have concocted in the past is largely missing, but each listen reveals another layer, another level, another reason to love it. Highly recommended.
	The band strikes the proper balance between ambition and pop instinct.
	Musically, it's the richest record of Pulp's career.... We Love Life isn't perfect, but it is vital. [Nov 2001, p.96]
	Invitingly lush. [23 Aug 2002, p.142]
	What saves this record from being another wallow in the misery of post-fame existence is the music.... 'We Love Life' is a grandiose, symphonic affair buoyed by succinct orchestration and white-light choral interludes.
	It's painstakingly layered and often lush, but sometimes scrubby and miserably sparse.
	Both messy and marvelous.
	One of the best albums of the 21st Century so far...and we are 5 years into it now...dare I say as good as "Different Class"?yes.

	I crossed Pulp off my list around 1999, figuring they had fallen into the depths of post Brit Pop depression. I kept hearing news of this I crossed Pulp off my list around 1999, figuring they had fallen into the depths of post Brit Pop depression. I kept hearing news of this album, but it kept being pushed back and redone and I thought it was never coming out. I didn't expect much of it either. But upon one listen I've realized that Pulp has just done what VERY few other bands can do. Pick themselves up, reinvent their style, and make awesome music once again. It's a different sound, a different direction, but its still Jarvis and it sounds equally as great as His n' Hers and Different Class. … Full Review »
