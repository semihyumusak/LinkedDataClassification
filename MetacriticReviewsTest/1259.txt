His guests on Sunday bring ferocious beats (like will.i.am on ''In the Ayer'') and infectious hooks (Sean Kingston on ''Roll'').
	He's a little bit Twista, a little bit Trick Daddy, and a whole lot Nelly. None of those things are negative, but the fact he can't distinguish himself from any of them isn't a positive.
	His hooks can be rock-solid ('Ack Like You Know') and his interest in gleaming synthesizerism (opener 'American Superstar' comes into 'Tubular Bells' territory, really) helps set him off from the legions of rappers clawing over each other to break out of the South.
	Flo Rida himself is able and charismatic, but doesn't sustain a compelling persona on every cut, which instead stand or fall (mostly the former) on their production.
	He has nimble delivery and a pleasing Nelly-esque hiccup to his voice. [May 2008, p.78]
	Here, he doesn't offer much more than a couple worthy singles and a handful of decent album cuts, and those highlights, such as the Timbaland-produced (and hogged) "Elevator," tend to be memorable more for the beats and the hooks than the rhymes.
	For every witty rhyme, there is enough cringe-worthy couplets.
	Other than the album's highlight, the resonant break-up song "Still Missin'," Mail on Sunday rarely delivers.
	The result is so robotic in its attempt to jolt every single pleasure center every single second that any twist of human joy, lust, awareness, or reflection is assimilated into its brittle, crunky Borg cube.
	For much of his debut album, Flo Rida seems like he's trying to match the broad appeal of "Low," but he has only limited success.
	His subjects are the standard sex/money/hustler/romance/gangster fantasies, and all the new-millennium fast life references you expect.
	He joylessly repeats all the tired tropes of Southern party rap (brand-name fetishizing, drug-trade mythologizing, stripper-bitch glorifying), and the album's best track has already been let out of the bag.
	There are only 4 songs I could say I actually enjoyed (Elevator, Priceless, Don't Know How To Act and Money Right) and the rest was terrible.There are only 4 songs I could say I actually enjoyed (Elevator, Priceless, Don't Know How To Act and Money Right) and the rest was terrible. This album gives hip hop a bad name.… Full Review »
