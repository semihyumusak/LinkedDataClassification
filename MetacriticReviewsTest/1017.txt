While the technical prowess on display throughout this set is truly awe-inspiring--Mastodon might turn everything up to 11, but they never compromise the finer facets of their sound, and everything's captured here in crystal-clear clarity.
	In all, Live at the Aragon has plenty for both old and new Mastodon fans to enjoy.
	Even at their most atonal, though, Mastodon's occasionally discordant vocalists hardly detract from the awesome power of their music. Besides, if you dig Mastodon enough to purchase a live album of theirs, you're pretty unlikely to take issue with the gruffness of their vocals, or the awkwardly sung harmonies.
	But for some off-key warbling, they might have slapped some crowd noise over the fantastically bonkers original. [May 2011, p.115]
	Things loosen up on older material (a thrashing "Aqua Dementia"), and the band do a punishing cover of the Melvins' 1996 psych-sludge gem "The Bit." Replacing the original's sitar with Hinds' 12-string guitar roar, Mastodon again prove themselves broad-minded headbangers.
	The vocals are hopelessly submerged in the mixing. Thankfully, the DVD provides brilliant (and necessary) distraction from the deflated vocal mix. [19 Mar 2011, p.52]
	In sum, Live at the Aragon is a mixed bag aurally and visually, though the Crack the Skye movie is killer.
	While not a total failure, Live at the Aragon still feels like a stopgap release rather than something that can stand alongside the formidable studio albums.
	Seventy-five minutes from the ambitious Atlantans untangles an actual hook in "Quintessence," but perennial "Mother Puncher" and Melvins closer "The Bit" batten down the goods vs. Crackthe Skye: The Movie jumbling a 50-minute New Age Russian silent.
