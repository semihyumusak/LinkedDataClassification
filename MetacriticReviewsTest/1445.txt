The compelling three-quarters of Definition of Real that seems to have crawled out of the gutter proves that Plies is best off when he does it the ski-mask way.
	He comes across as a Southern-fried early DMX with his unabated aggression; raw, explosive verse; and hints of conscience.
	As it stands, Definition of Real may not be an instant classic, but it isn't a sophomore slump either, and there are signs that there could be more to Plies beyond his drawl and his love of female reproductive organs.
	This follow-up to his striking debut album, “The Real Testament” (2007), lacks some of that album’s rawness, but is still strong, thanks to his shockingly literal and unforgiving rhymes.
	He knows what reality is. It's giving grief a bad name.
	i try to like plies but theres no way i can. This album has some ok songs but most of the album is simply trash. Atleast Goon affiliated was good.....
