Signal Morning is not only a vital part of that continued excellence; it’s one of the best damn albums of the year.
	It surpasses the previous Circulatory System effort, and stands to rival the best of Olivia Tremor Control's output.
	MS may have temporarily slowed the Athens, Ga., musician’s output, but it has not diminished its quality.
	The real nuggets of the album, however, lie in the moments when the inherent melancholy behind Hart’s doe-eyed mysticism comes out.
	That's Signal Morning's greatest strength: It's a supremely busy record that at the same time doesn't sound fussed over.
	The decaying aural ellipsis felt hanging in the aether marks the dusky road of the album’s fist half. This is dark stuff, darker than our main man Hart is known for.
	It seems trivial for album length to be the crux of what makes Signal Morning work, but with one’s attention less spread out, less diluted, Hart’s musical strategy becomes that much more powerful. It’s the old showbiz adage: always leave ‘em wanting more.
	As the pieces continue to invert themselves halfway through their running time, the album begins to resemble a child’s ambitious science experiment gone haywire. For this, Signal Morning shines.
	One of Hart's sharpest decisions is to keep everything short--17 songs over the course of 45 minutes, which if not quite Ramones level is still pretty brisk--while ensuring each piece has its own individual character.
	This dense, complex document is an impressive display of vitality by the Athens, Georgia–based Elephant 6 collective, as Will Cullen Hart of the late Olivia Tremor Control weds that band’s bizarre breakdowns with Apples in Stereo’s earnest tunefulness.
	Once you get inside this static, it's the ideal place to hang out. [Oct 2009, p.106]
	For the most part, the record never gets off the ground the way good bedroom psychedelia should. [Summer 2009, p.60]
