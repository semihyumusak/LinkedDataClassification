Mar Dulce has to be counted as a success, certainly because the combined effect of songwriting, performance, and production sounds of a piece, with few seams showing.
	Tango remains the constant for Bajofondo, but the 17 tracks offer quite a few variations on a theme.
	There are four reasons why this album is necessary: firstly, it will make any party you happen to be soundtracking sound very clever. Secondly, following the samples and contributions will open up a whole world of modern and traditional music from the Southern Cone to you. Thirdly, both live and on stage, tracks like Pa'bailar rock a squeezebox like you've never heard. And, finally, Ry Cooder is nowhere in sight.
	No doubt about it, from first note to last, Mar Dulce (loose translation: "the Sweet Sea") is a most tasty dive.
	Bajofondo brings in guest vocalists as wild cards: singers including Nelly Furtado, Elvis Costello, the Argentine rockers Gustavo Cerati and Juan Subirá, the Mexican rocker Julieta Venegas and the octogenarian Uruguayan tango singer Lágrima Ríos, in her last recording, as well as rapping by Mala Rodriguez (from Spain) and Santullo (from Uruguay). They tip the balance toward imperfect, immediate humanity, and their drama rubs off on the instrumentals too.
	The best album of the year until now. The mix of tango and electronic music with the addition of great singers gives as result a memorable album.
	Interesting how it's got an 84 overall rating, with no individual rating higher than an 80.
	This is yet another great album from Bajofondo. The variation (from rap to progressive styles) in the music sounds great altogether and the This is yet another great album from Bajofondo.

Very, very recommended.… Full Review »
