Although Avi's taken a few risks with Ghostbird, the artist has still delivered a record full of material that could easily be used as the backdrop for a "stay positive" surf film--a comfortable range for the singer's talents.
	Ghostbird is a summer album for adventurous folk fans, engaging on its first run-thru but packed with enough twists and turns to warrant repeated listens.
	While the Malaysian songstress' charming vocals are easily the main attraction, Avi's unexpected stroll through different sonic territories-hopping from pop ("The Book of Morris Johnson") to R&B ("Concrete Wall") and reggae ("Roll Your Head In The Sun")--is a close second.
	Like most music in 2011, it sounds remarkably pretty. And, like just about everything in 2011, it is completely, perhaps compulsively, adrift.
