We're treated with music that demonstrates a perfect niche between pop-accessibility and zany experimentation.
	On his eponymous debut, Mikal Cronin proves he can hold his own.
	A debut that will fry your ears and break your heart. [Jan 2012, 100]
	Mikal Cronin a master of crafting the impressionistic pop gem--accessible, catchy, ambrosial, and evocative--and that's a rare and peculiar talent.
	Cronin learned how to pack garage/punk fuzzbombs with big hooks as the Moonhearts' frontman, and he hasn't lost the ragged-and-reckless urgency here.[#81, p. 55]
	Small, but near-perfectly formed. [Nov 2011, p.90]
	Thanks to Cronin's studio drummer, producer, and fuzz friend, Ty Segall, the record has plenty of dirt all over it, placing the overarching tone of the album somewhere between Velvet Underground's Loaded and The White Stripes' White Blood Cells.
	The Suicide-meets-Can growl that opens "Green and Blue," for instance, may be a familiar element in other revivals, but Cronin puts enough of a hooky spin on the feedback rampage to help make it stand out as the album's first down-the-line success.
	It's a rarity, though, when kids successfully switch from absorbing listlessness totransmitting it themselves. That's the case for Mikal Cronin, who takes these circumstances and makes something of it that is big and varied and hyperactive.
