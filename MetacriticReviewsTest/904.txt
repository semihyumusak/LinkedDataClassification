Overall, though the lyric content is among the best on a Tim McGraw album to date.
	Emotional Traffic is McGraw's most ambitious offering to date--the credits list is enormous and the range of styles on display is wide. That said, its balance is impeccable.
	Should country purists fret? Nah. "Touchdown Jesus" lives up to its down-home promise.
	Bursting with enough potential singles to suggest that the most-played male artist of the last decade will continue to dominate country radio.
	Strong storytelling redeems cheesy stuff like "Touchdown Jesus," as does the music, a savvy mix of down-home twang, pop tunefulness and rock heft.
	Mr. McGraw has never sounded this casual. It doesn't suit him.
	Emotional Traffic isn't dramatically better, worse or all that different from what he's been doing since the beginning.
	Emotional Traffic only works in its moments of restraint and relative good taste, and those are exceedingly rare.
	Emotional Traffic contains a few soppy homilies to domesticity, a transparent bid for a Super Bowl halftime booking, and a great many reasons to listen to the equally polished, but vastly wittier, Brad Paisley. [May 2012, p.78]
