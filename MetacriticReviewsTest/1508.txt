Leadoff track "Six Feet Under"- with its whispery falsetto chorus skewered by the ominous plea, "Call me when you're six feet underground" - is among the catchiest and most emotionally exposed songs Auer has ever recorded. [Jul/Aug 2006, p.86]
	A deeply thoughtful and obviously personal album.
	The care Auer put into Songs is audible for the entire disc.
	This is Jon Auer at his best. [#13, p.83]

	Auer may have the lower profile of the two lead Posies, but he's every bit the artisan his bandmate is-- and his solo debut is ultimately a satisfying listen.

	By far the best record to come from the Posies clan! I only hope the next one doesn't take 6 years to come out!
