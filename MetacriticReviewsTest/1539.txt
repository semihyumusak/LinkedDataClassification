A palatable but undistinguished batch of slow- to medium-tempo R&B fare.
	This attempt at old-fashioned star-making might have worked if Bria Valente had a smidgeon of star charisma but she's merely a pleasantly breathy crooner, slipping easily into Prince's shimmering quiet storm production.
	Elixer is at least a more pleasant listen; ignore the Prince mystique and it's a collection of reasonably well-turned pop ballads.
	Elixir showcases Bria Valente, whose sultry-but-dull vocals don’t foretell great things.
	Polite and polished, the music amounts to little more than R&B lite with washes of bossa nova and strings.
	The problem is that not enough of Elixer sounds strong or fresh.
	It's about average for albums from Prince proteges.
	Her 10 strenuously generic tracks are pure R&B Ambien, and the lady is no Sheila E.
	The third disc, Bria Valente's Elixer, is a tepid afterthought.
	Her ten tracks are disposable, and redeemed only by Prince’s extraordinary production ear.
	Valente has a pleasant, if thin, voice--she doesn’t have the chops to elevate this material into anything memorable.
	Elixer runs the gamut of bland-but-classy R&B, from antiseptic slow jams to rote dance-pop, slick as you'd expect and completely failing to suggest what bunched Prince's panties when he initially discovered Valente.
