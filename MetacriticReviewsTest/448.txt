It's Bummer Time, and in 2011 there is no better soundtrack for banging your head to oblivion.
	Forever Abomination will appeal to fans of metal, whichever camp they're in. [8 Oct 2011, p.51]
	This blend of driving riffage and suffocating relentlessness allows the band to strike a fine balance between freewheeling guitar worship and oppressive gloom.
	Packed with epic melodies, searing solos, and medieval horror imagery, Forever Abomination totally rocks, aided by (finally for these guys!) a perfect production sound.
	Basically, this is exciting, skilled, fist-pumping, true-to-life stuff made by good-seeming guys who, in the end, aren't afraid to laugh, goof around, or make fun of themselves.
	On their fourth full-length, they sound as menacing as ever. [Nov 2011, p.97]
