Although the album does lag a bit toward the end--not due to a lack of quality but to the inability to match the album's earlier dazzling heights--it's a very respectable addition to the Swedish canon.
	While Those Dancing Days may struggle to last in the easy come, easy go world of indie pop, let alone stand out amidst the current glut of Swedish imports cluttering our shelves, In Our Space Hero Suits proves they deserve their five minutes of fame.
	Alongside the preternaturally mature croon of frontlady Linnea Jonsson, those threads fit seamlessly:
	This may well get those girls on the dancefloor but it crucially lacks the subtle depth to give it that all-important soul.
	On singles 'Hitten' and 'Those Dancing Days,' the coruscating tunes, bolstered by swirling synth melodies and rippling drums, are irresistible; but too much of the rest of the music here burbles along inconsequentially.
	Musically, they could do with a few more gear changes, but it's churlish to complain when the overall effect is so spirit-lifting. [Nov 2008, p.123]
	Technically it's well crafted pop music, that is undeniable--and on individual songs it's a success--but as an album it fails, it's a distancing record, it doesn't engage you and, if anything, it alienates you with its lack of evolution and variation.
	The music on this debut is nutritionally meager powerpop. [Nov 2008, p.120]
