A landmark album that is Carpenter's best effort since 1994's Stones in the Road -- and, quite possibly, her best ever.
	This album - musically more extravagant, lyrically just as searching - takes its place at the shoulder of 1994's Stones In The Road as her best yet.
	While her introspection and understated approach bog things down at times, songs like "The Dreaming Road" and "King of Love" are finely crafted and often hauntingly beautiful.
	Carpenter delivers a batch of reassuring songs -- about confidence in yourself and the world -- making you wish she'd check in a bit more often.
	She's always straddled musical genres, and Time*Sex*Love boasts a clear pop streak, with the influence of the Beach Boys evident on the harmonies of "Maybe World" and the string arrangements on "What Was It Like" and "King of Love."
	Stick with her slow, depressing stuff, and bring your Zoloft. [6/1/2001, p.90]
