Accompanied by London's Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, Sting reimagines Roxanne as a lush Latin ballad and gives Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic a swelling Celtic thrust.
	It's lively and fun, and it's Sting's most satisfying record in a long time.
	Certainly an orchestra is a big enough umbrella, but some of the songs--from both the Police and Sting's solo career--definitely end up getting wet.
	Sting has shown he's a rocker who knows how to scale up.
	You expect the worst from Police faves like Roxanne and Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, since those tunes were tautly written, with minimal pop intricacy. But the RPCO adds an interesting melancholic layer to the former, giving it more drama, as orchestras tend to do.
	The results are not bad, but entirely too safe. This should come as a surprise to no one, considering how classical renditions of pop music tend to be overly flat-footed and not especially risky.
	There are only a few moments when Symphonicities doesn't seem completely preposterous.
