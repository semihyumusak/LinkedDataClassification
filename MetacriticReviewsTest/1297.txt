While its upbeat rockers add a welcome sense of urgency, Free Somehow is most interesting when it is slow, pensive and bleak.
	Although Free Somehow doesn't reach the energy level of Widespread Panic's best live performances, with Herring in place, the band has certainly rediscovered its musical roots.
	Herring's fluid performances are as tight as an extra-small Phish T-shirt on a fat roadie, even if some tracks make for better six-string showcases than others. [15 Feb 2007, p.67]
	It's certainly their most adventuresome, but overdone production touches from Terry Manning (ZZ Top, Al Green), who brings horns and an orchestra into the mix, blur some material.
	So while Free Somehow can't quite rival the energy of a Widespread show, it still offers something that those concerts cannot, making the album a worthwhile purchase for most dedicated fans.
	Stylistically and harmonically, Free Somehow is a departure from Widespread Panic’s recognizable sanguine Southern rock.
	Free Somehow has its moments, but as ever, there's something missing. [May 2008, p.141]
	Free Somehow, which marks the debut of new-ish guitarist Jimmy Herring, is no less of a tease, boasting three or four memorable songs (none mightier than 'Airplane') and the rest serviceable filler.
	Free Somehow sounds like what happens when ­wizened road warriors hit the studio begrudgingly.
	Dark Day Program is beautiful. A different song than I have ever heard from Panic. The CD is a roller coaster ride.
