It's Em's show, for sure, and being surrounded by a talented, fast-talking crew has made him even more engaging than he is on his own.
	Shock tactics and chest thumping still predominate, but satirical cuts... give this spit session much-needed polish. [30 Apr 2004, p.162]
	Legitimizes the D12ers as much more than simply Eminem's funky bunch. [Jun 2004, p.157]
	But if the rote button-pushing gets bleak, the beats and battle rhymes are state-of-the-art. [Jun 2004, p.103]
	A likable ensemble effort, slopping over with infectious choruses and political incorrectness.
	The male affinity is so intense, it approaches homoeroticism. [#27, p.138]
	They have made an art of mediocre rap over above average tracks.
	Like Get Rich or Die Tryin', only not as good, D12 World works as a polished dramatization of a lifestyle nobody really lives.
	The album feels more slapped together than their debut.
	This is mainly just D12's other five anonymous members moaning on about the lack of credit they get by dropping the most underwhelming rhymes this side of the last Dogg Pound album.
	To live in their world is like being trapped at an idiot's convention and almost  but only almost - as bad as Limp Bizkit.
	The problem with D12 isnt that all of them are crap, its just that theyre not given enough room to breath and prove themselves to be better than average.
	This record is about as bad it is possible for a record to be. It is offensive on every level - the music is bad, the rapping is bad, the sleeve is bad.

Nontheless, many of the tracks are entertaining, and my specific praise goes to the emotional Good Die Young, where the members of the group pay their respects to fallen friend Bugz. An almost complete disconnection to the rest of the album, which focusses mainly on comedy and light-hearted misogyny. Bizarre's Just Like You track is particularly...well, Bizarre. At least he's living up to his name.… Full Review »
