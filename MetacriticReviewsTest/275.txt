Elegiac by intent, the record is awash in poignancy, radiating from the deeply felt guitar and vocal performances of the 83-year-old King and his supporting band (anchored by drummer Jim Keltner, bassist Nathan East and pianist Dr. John) and from the carefully chosen material.
	Even if King winds up returning to his familiar slick, star-studded sound somewhere down the line, having an album as earthily elegant as One Kind Favor in his canon provides a fitting coda for one of the great musical careers of the 20th century.
	This is his best since his 2000 collaboration with Eric Clapton, "Riding with the King."
	He and Lucille are still as one and the guitar licks come exquisite and often. [Nov 2008, p.119]
	The result is a rich, easy-rolling album that finds King's fingers still nimble and his megaphone voice barely creaking. [Dec 2008, p.100]
	This isn't just B.B. King's best album in years, it's one of the strongest studio sets of his career, standing alongside classics such as "Singin' the Blues" and "Lucille."
	The ache, the anger, the elegance and the edge of Mr. Kingâ€™s blues are undiminished and authentic.
	This is his best in aeons. [Nov 2008, p.121]
	Wow, he's still making albums? That's incredible, considering his age.
	A musical journey into almost forgotten feelings a great album and a great T-Bone Burnett production
