An embarrassment of riches. [#58, p.91]
	It's every ounce of Idlewild's potential fulfilled at once.
	This is arguably Idlewilds finest hour.
	They've become accomplished, exciting, restrained and wise.
	Sounding assured and triumphant, Scotland's finest finally have realised their true potential. [Aug 2002, p.112]
	Giddy, confident, and instantly memorable, The Remote Part is great Brit pop and great rock & roll.
	The four-piece has transformed into a genuine powerhouse, blowing away any so-called new rock revolution contenders with lovely melodies and effortless intensity.
	They ratchet up the latent R.E.M.-isms, elevating themselves heads above their musical kin.
	There is nothing groundbreaking about this LP; it's just classic.
	The Remote Part captures a divinely aged five-piece.
	Idlewild are rapidly outgrowing their influences as they forge a unique identity that leads me to suspect that they may soon be inspiring a slew of like-minded new bands.
	THe result is like a cross between R.E.M. and Coldplay, but Idlewild show their true smarts by continuing to attack every track with youthful energy and passion. [Apr 2003, p.124]
	Idlewild have added a new "dirty bomb" to their armoury: the emotional resonance of prime Morrissey/Marr. [Aug 2002, p.128]
	While it doesn't have as many flat-out terrific songs as its predecessor, I'd venture to say that The Remote Part is the record that Idlewild has wanted to write all along.
	It's overshadowed by many of the band's recent, U.K.-only B sides. [21 Mar 2003, p.113]
	It may be the album Idlewild was born to make, but despite some spectacular moments, its momentum wanes a tiny bit as it gets closer to the end.
	The Remote Part is Idlewild Mark II--sleeker, bolder, better. [Oct 2002, p.107]
	Merely good-but-not-great.
	Idlewild are compelling when they put Woomble's sad-sack lyrics front and center, but on aggressively average rockers like "You Held The World In Your Arms" and "Century After Century," the band's turgid squall swamps his words. [Jun 2003, p.103]
	The album starts to wear thin by the homestretch.
